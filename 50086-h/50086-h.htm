<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Perhaps it is expected of a writer who steps out of
the sphere of his ordinary pursuits, and deals with such a
subject as that which is treated in this work, that he will
account for his so doing. It is not necessary for me to say
that no class of men can have a monopoly in any subject.
But I am quite willing to take my readers into my confidence
so far as to state how I came to write this book.</p>

<p>Most men, who have a special pursuit, find the necessity
for recreation of some kind. Some take it in one way, and
some in another. It has been my habit through life to seek
occasional relief from the monotony of professional vocations
in intellectual pursuits of another character. Having
this habit&mdash;which I have found by experience has no tendency
to lessen one's capacity for the duties of a profession,
or one's relish of its occupations&mdash;I some years ago took
up the study of the modern doctrine of animal evolution.
Until after the death of the late Mr. Charles Darwin, I
had not given a very close attention to this subject. The
honors paid to his memory, and due to his indefatigable
research and extensive knowledge, led me to examine his
"Descent of Man" and his "Origin of Species," both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
which I studied with care, and I trust with candor. I was
next induced to examine the writings of Mr. Herbert
Spencer on the subject of evolution, with which I had also
been previously unacquainted except in a general way. I
was a good deal surprised at the extent of Mr. Spencer's
reputation as a thinker, and by the currency which his peculiar
philosophy has had in this country, where it has led,
among the young and inexperienced, as well as among
older persons, to very incorrect habits of reasoning on subjects
of the highest importance. The result of my studies
of these writers is the present book. I have written it because
I have seen, or believe that I have seen, where the
conflict arises between some of the deductions of modern
science and the principles which ought to regulate not
only religious belief, but belief in anything that is not
open to the direct observation of our senses. But I trust
that I shall not be understood as having written for the
purpose of specially defending the foundations of religious
belief. This is no official duty of mine. How theologians
manage, or ought to manage, the argument which is to
convince men of the existence and methods of God, it is
not for me to say. But a careful examination of the new
philosophy has convinced me that those who are the special
teachers of religious truth have need of great caution in
the admissions or concessions which they make, when they
undertake to reconcile some of the conclusions of modern
scientists with belief in a Creator. I do not here speak of
the Biblical account of the creation, but I speak of that
belief in a Creator which is to be deduced from the phenomena
of nature. While there are naturalists, scientists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
and philosophers at the present day, whose speculations do
not exclude the idea of a Supreme Being, there are others
whose theories are entirely inconsistent with a belief in a
personal God, the Creator and Governor of the universe.
Moreover, although there are great differences in this respect
between the different persons who accept evolution
in some form, the whole doctrine of the development of
distinct species out of other species makes demands upon
our credulity which are irreconcilable with the principles
of belief by which we regulate, or ought to regulate, our acceptance
of any new matter of belief. The principles of
belief which we apply in the ordinary affairs of life are
those which should be applied to scientific or philosophical
theories; and inasmuch as the judicial method of reasoning
upon facts is at once the most satisfactory and the
most in accordance with common sense, I have here undertaken
to apply it to the evidence which is supposed to establish
the hypothesis of animal evolution, in contrast with
the hypothesis of special creations.</p>

<p>I am no ecclesiastic. I advance no arguments in favor of
one or another interpretation of the Scriptures about which
there is controversy among Christians. While I firmly believe
that God exists, and that he has made a revelation
to mankind, whereby he has given us direct assurance of
immortality, I do not know that this belief disqualifies me
from judging, upon proper principles of evidence, of the
soundness of a theory which denies that he specially created
either the body or the mind of man. How far the hypothesis
of evolution, by destroying our belief that God
specially created us, tends to negative any purpose for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
which we can suppose him to have made to us a revelation
of our immortality, it is for the theologian to consider.
For myself, I am not conscious that in examining the
theory of evolution I have been influenced by my belief
in what is called revealed religion. I have, at all events,
studiously excluded from the argument all that has been
inculcated by the Hebrew or the Christian records as authorized
or inspired teachings, and have treated the Mosaic
account of the creation like any other hypothesis of
the origin of man and the other animals. The result of
my study of the hypothesis of evolution is, that it is an ingenious
but delusive mode of accounting for the existence
of either the body or the mind of man; and that it employs
a kind of reasoning which no person of sound judgment
would apply to anything that might affect his welfare,
his happiness, his estate, or his conduct in the practical
affairs of life.</p>

<p>He who would truly know what the doctrine of evolution
is, and to what it leads, must literally begin at the
beginning. He must free his mind from the cant of agnosticism
and from the cant of belief. He must refuse to
accept dogmas on the authority of any one, be they the
dogmas of the scientist, or of the theologian. He must
learn that his mental nature is placed under certain
laws, as surely as his corporeal structure; and he must
cheerfully obey the necessities which compel him to accept
some conclusions and to reject others. Keeping his
reasoning powers in a well-balanced condition, he must
prove all things, holding fast to that which is in conformity
with sound deduction, and to that alone. But all per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>sons
may not be able to afford the time to pursue truth in
this way, or may not have the facilities for the requisite
research. It seemed to me, therefore, that an effort to do
for them what they can not do for themselves would be
acceptable to a great many people.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the imaginary philosopher
whom I have introduced in some of my chapters under
the name of Sophereus, or the searcher after wisdom, debating
the doctrines of evolution with a supposed disciple
of that school, whom I have named Kosmicos, is an impossible
person. It may perhaps be said that the conception
of a man absolutely free from all dogmatic religious
teaching, from all bias to any kind of belief, and yet having
as much knowledge of various systems of belief as I
have imputed to this imaginary person, would in modern
society be the conception of an unattainable character.
My answer to this criticism would be that I felt myself at
liberty to imagine any kind of character that would suit
my purpose. How successfully I have carried out the
idea of a man in mature life entirely free from all preconceived
opinions, and forming his beliefs upon principles
of pure reason, it is for my readers to judge. With
regard to the other interlocutor in the dialogues, I hope
it is not necessary for me to say that I do not impute all
of his opinions or arguments to the professors of the evolution
school, or to any section of it. He is a representative
of the effects of some of their teachings, but not an
individual portrait. But as, for the purposes of the antagonism,
it was expedient to put into the mouth of this
person whatever can be said in favor of the hypothesis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
evolution, it became necessary to make him represent the
dogmatic side of the theory; and thus to make the collision
and contrast between the minds of the two debaters
as strong as I could. Controversial discussion in the
form of debate has been used from the time of Plato.
While I have adopted a method, I have not presumed to
imitate its great exemplars. But for the value of that
method I shall presently cite weighty testimony. It was
a relief to me to resort to it after having pursued the
subject in the more usual form of discussion; and indeed
it forced itself upon me as a kind of necessity, because
it seemed the fairest way of presenting what could
be said on both sides of the question. I hope it may have
the good fortune to keep alive the interest of the reader,
after he has perused the previous chapters.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of all positive writing or discourse
is that there is no one to confute, to contradict, or to
maintain the negative. At the bar, and in some public
assemblies, there is an antagonist; and truth is elicited
by the collision. But in didactic writing, especially on
a philosophical topic, it is best to introduce an antagonist,
and to make him speak in his own person. Two
of the best thinkers of our time have forcibly stated the
advantage&mdash;the necessity, in short&mdash;of personal debate.
Mr. John Stuart Mill, in his essay on Liberty, observes
that&mdash;</p>

<p>"The loss of so important an aid to the intelligent
and living apprehension of a truth as is afforded by the
necessity of explaining it to or defending it against opponents,
though not sufficient to outweigh, is no trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
drawback from the benefits of its universal recognition.
Where this advantage can not be had, I confess I should
like to see the teachers of mankind endeavoring to provide
a substitute for it; some contrivance for making the
difficulties of the question as present to the learner's consciousness
as if they were pressed upon him by a dissentient
champion eager for his conversion.</p>

<p>"But instead of seeking contrivances for this purpose,
they have lost those they formerly had. The Socratic
dialectics, so magnificently exemplified in the dialogues
of Plato, were a contrivance of this description. They
were essentially a discussion of the great questions of life
and philosophy, directed with consummate skill to the
purpose of convincing any one, who had merely adopted
the commonplaces of received opinion, that he did not
understand the subject&mdash;that he as yet attached no definite
meaning to the doctrines he professed, in order that,
becoming aware of his ignorance, he might be put in the
way to attain a stable belief, resting on a clear apprehension
both of the meaning of doctrines and of their evidence.
The school disputations of the middle ages had
a similar object. They were intended to make sure that
the pupil understood his own opinion, and (by necessary
correlation) the opinion opposed to it, and could enforce
the grounds of one and confute those of the other. The
last-mentioned contests had, indeed, the incurable defect
that the premises appealed to were taken from authority,
not from reason; and as a discipline to the mind they
were in every respect inferior to the powerful dialectics
which formed the intellects of the 'Socratici viri.' But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
the modern mind owes far more to both than it is generally
willing to admit; and the present modes of instruction
contain nothing which in the smallest degree supplies
the place either of the one or of the other.... It is the
fashion of the present time to disparage negative logic&mdash;that
which points out weakness in theory or errors in
practice, without establishing positive truths. Such negative
criticism would indeed be poor enough as an ultimate
result, but as a means to attaining any positive
knowledge or conviction worthy the name, it can not be
valued too highly; and until people are again systematically
trained to it there will be few great thinkers, and a
low general average of intellect in any but the mathematical
and physical departments of speculation. On
any other subject no one's opinions deserve the name of
knowledge, except so far as he has either had forced upon
him by others, or gone through of himself, the same
mental process which would have been required of him
in carrying on an active controversy with opponents."</p>

<p>Mr. Grote, in his admirable work on "Plato and the
other Companions of Socrates," has the following passage:</p>

<p>"Plato is usually extolled by his admirers as the champion
of the Absolute&mdash;of unchangeable forms, immutable
truth, objective necessity, cogent and binding on every
one. He is praised for having refuted Protagoras, who
can find no standard beyond the individual recognition
and belief of his own mind or that of some one else.
There is no doubt that Plato often talks in that strain,
but the method followed in his dialogues, and the general
principles of methods which he lays down here as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
elsewhere, point to a directly opposite conclusion. Of this
the Phædrus is a signal instance. Instead of the extreme
of generality, it proclaims the extreme of speciality. The
objection which the Socrates of the Phædrus advances
against the didactic efficacy of written discourse is founded
on the fact that it is the same to all readers&mdash;that it takes
no cognizance of the differences of individual minds nor
of the same mind at different times. Socrates claims for
dialectic debate the valuable privilege that it is constant
action and reaction between two individual minds&mdash;an
appeal by the inherent force and actual condition of each
to the like elements in the other&mdash;an ever-shifting presentation
of the same topics, accommodated to the measure
of intelligence and cast of emotion in the talkers and at
the moment. The individuality of each mind&mdash;both questioner
and respondent&mdash;is here kept in view as the governing
condition of the process. No two minds can be approached
by the same road or by the same interrogation.
The questioner can not advance a step except by the admission
of the respondent. Every respondent is the measure
to himself. He answers suitably to his own belief;
he defends by his own suggestions; he yields to the pressure
of contradiction and inconsistency <em>when he feels them</em>,
and not before. Each dialogist is (to use the Protagorean
phrase) the measure to himself of truth and falsehood,
according as he himself believes it. Assent or dissent,
whichever it may be, springs only from the free working
of the individual mind in its actual condition then and
there. It is to the individual mind alone that appeal is
made, and this is what Protagoras asks for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>"We thus find, in Plato's philosophical character, two
extreme opposite tendencies and opposite poles co-existent.
We must recognize them both, but they can never be
reconciled; sometimes he obeys and follows the one, sometimes
the other.</p>

<p>"If it had been Plato's purpose to proclaim and impose
upon every one something which he called 'Absolute
Truth,' one and the same alike imperative upon all, he
would best proclaim it by preaching or writing. To
modify this 'Absolute,' according to the varieties of the
persons addressed, would divest it of its intrinsic attribute
and excellence. If you pretend to deal with an Absolute,
you must turn away your eyes from all diversity of apprehending
intellects and believing subjects."</p>

<p>With such testimony to the value of dialectic debate,
I hope that my adoption of it as a method will be regarded
as something better than an affectation.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer, in one of his works,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> referring to and
quoting from Berkeley's "Dialogues of Hylas and Philolaus,"
observes that "imaginary conversation affords great
facilities for gaining a victory. When you can put into
an adversary's mouth just such replies as suit your purpose,
there is little difficulty in reaching the desired conclusion."
I have not written to gain a victory; and,
indeed, I am quite aware that it would be impossible to
gain one over those with whom I can have no common
ground of reasoning. In the imaginary conversations in
this work, I have taken great care not to put into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
mouth of the supposed representative of the doctrine of
evolution anything that would suit my own purpose; and,
in every instance in which I have represented him as relying
on the authority of Mr. Darwin or of Mr. Spencer, I
have either made him quote the words or have made him
state the positions as I suppose they must be understood,
and have referred the reader to the proper page in the
works of those writers.</p>

<p>And here I will render all honor to the admirable candor
with which Mr. Darwin discussed objections to his
theory which have been propounded by others, and suggested
further difficulties himself. If I do not pay the
same tribute to Mr. Spencer, the reason will be found in
those portions of my work in which I have had occasion
to call in question his methods of reasoning.</p>

<p>Some repetition of facts and arguments will be found
in the following pages in the different aspects in which
the subject is treated. This has been intentional. When
the tribunal that is addressed is a limited and special one,
and is composed of a high order of minds accustomed to
deal with such a science, for example, as jurisprudence, he
who undertakes to produce conviction can afford to use
condensation. He seldom has to repeat what he has once
said; and often, the more compact his argument, the
more likely it will be to command assent if it is clear as
well as close. But this work is not addressed to such a
tribunal. It is written for various classes of readers, some
of whom have already a special acquaintance with the subject,
some of whom have less, and some of whom have
now none at all. It is designed to explain what the theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
of evolution is, and to encounter it in the mode best
adapted to reach the various minds of which the mass of
readers is composed. If I had written only for scientists
and philosophers, I should not have repeated anything.</p>

<p>For similar reasons I have added to this volume both a
general index and a glossary of the scientific and technical
terms which I have had occasion to use.</p>

<p>The whole of the text of this work had been written
and electrotyped before I had an opportunity to see the
very interesting "Life and Correspondence" of the illustrious
naturalist, the late Louis Agassiz, edited by his
accomplished widow, Mrs. Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, and
published in October, 1885, by Houghton, Mifflin and
Company, Boston. For a long period of years, after his
residence in this country began, and until my removal
from Boston to New York in 1862, I enjoyed as much of
his intimacy as would be likely to subsist between persons
of such different pursuits. I believe that I understood his
general views of creation, from his lectures and conversation.
It is now made entirely certain that he never accepted
the doctrine of evolution of distinct types out of
preceding and different types by ordinary generation; and
it has been to me an inexpressible satisfaction to find that
the opinions and reasoning contained in my work, and
adopted independently of any influence of his, are confirmed
by what has now been given to the world. I need
only refer to his letter to Prof. Sedgwick, written in June,
1845, and to his latest utterance, the paper on "Evolution
and Permanence of Type," in the thirty-third volume of
the "Atlantic Monthly," published after his lamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
death in 1873, for proof that his opinions on the Darwinian
theory never changed. Of all the scientists whom I
have ever known, or whose writings I have read, Agassiz
always seemed to me the broadest as well as the most exact
and logical reasoner.</p>

<p class="intro">Nature and importance of the subject&mdash;Is there a relation of Creator and
creature between God and man?&mdash;Rules of rational belief&mdash;Is natural
theology a progressive science?</p>


<p>Man finds himself in the universe a conscious and
thinking being. He has to account to himself for his own
existence. He is impelled to this by an irresistible propensity,
which is constantly leading him to look both inward
and outward for an answer to the questions: What
am I? How came I to be? What is the limit of my existence?
Is there any other being in the universe between
whom and myself there exists the relation of Creator and
creature?</p>

<p>The whole history of the human mind, so far as we have
any reliable history, is marked by this perpetual effort to
find a First Cause.</p>

<p>However wild and fantastic may be the idea which the
savage conceives of a being stronger and wiser than himself;
however groveling and sensual may be his conception
of the form, or attributes, or action of that being, he is,
when he strives after the comprehension of his deity, engaged
in the same intellectual effort that is made by the
most civilized and cultivated of mankind, when, speculating
upon the origin of the human soul, or its relation to
the universe, or the genesis of the material world, they
reach the sublime conception of an infinite God, the creator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of all other spiritual existences and of all the forms of animal
life, or when they end in the theory that there is no
God, or in that other theory which supposes that what we
call the creation, man included, is an evolution out of primordial
matter, which has been operated upon by certain
fixed laws, without any special interposition of a creating
power, exerted in the production of the forms of animal
life that now inhabit this earth, or ever have inhabited it.
In the investigation of these contrasted theories, it is necessary
to remember that the faculties of the human mind are
essentially the same in all conditions of civilization or barbarism;
that they differ only in the degree of their growth,
activity, and power of reasoning, and therefore that there
must be a common standard to which to refer all beliefs.
The sole standard to which we can refer a belief in anything
is its rationality, or a comparison between that which is believed
and that which is most probable, according to the
power of human reason to weigh probabilities. In the untutored
and uncultivated savage, this power, although it
exists, is still very feeble; partly because it is exercised
upon only a few objects, and partly because the individual
has comparatively but little opportunity to know all the
elements which should be taken into account in determining
a question of moral probabilities.</p>

<p>In the educated and cultivated man this power of judging
probabilities, of testing beliefs by their rationality, is
carried, or is capable of being carried, to the highest point
of development, so as to comprehend in the calculation the
full elements of the question, or at least to reduce the
danger of some fatal omission to the minimum. It is, of
course, true that the limited range of our faculties may prevent
a full view of all the elements of any question of probability,
even when our faculties have attained the highest
point of development experienced by the age in which we
happen to live. This renders the rationality of any hy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>pothesis
less than an absolutely certain test of truth. But
this rationality is all that we have to apply to any question
of belief; and if we attend carefully to the fact that moral
probabilities constitute the groundwork of all our beliefs,
and note the mental processes by which we reach conclusions
upon any question depending upon evidence, we shall find
reason to regard this power of testing beliefs by a conformity
between the hypotheses and that which is most probable
to be the most glorious attribute of the human understanding,
as it is unquestionably the safest guide to which we
can trust ourselves.</p>

<p>It may be that, while philosophers will not object to
my definition of rationality, churchmen will ask what place
I propose to assign to authority in the formation of beliefs.
I answer, in the first place, that I am seeking to make myself
understood by plain but reflecting and reasoning people.
Such persons will perceive that what I mean by the rationality
of a belief in any hypothesis is its fitness to be accepted
and acted upon because it has in its favor the strongest
probabilities of the case, so far as we can grasp those probabilities.
I know of no other foundation for a belief in anything;
for belief is the acceptance by the mind of some
proposition, statement, or supposed fact, the truth of which
depends upon evidence addressed to our senses, or to our
intellectual perceptions, or to both. In the next place, in
regard to the influence of authority over our beliefs, it is
to be observed that the existence of the authority is a question
to be determined by evidence, and this question, therefore,
of itself involves an application of the test of rationality,
or conformity with what is probable. But, assuming
that the authority is satisfactorily established, it is not safe
to leave all minds to the teaching of that authority, without
the aid of the reasoning, which, independent of all authority,
would conduct to the same conclusion. There are
many minds to whom it is useless to say, You are com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>manded
to believe. The question instantly arises, Commanded
by whom, or what? And if the answer is, By the
Church, or by the Bible, and the matter is left to rest upon
that statement, there is great danger of unbelief. It is
apparent that a large amount of what is called infidelity, or
unbelief, now prevailing in the world, is due to the fact
that men are told that they are commanded to believe, as if
they were to be passive recipients of what is asserted, and
because so little is addressed to their understandings.</p>

<p>I do not wish to be understood as maintaining that
there is no place for authority in matters of what is called
religious belief. I am quite sensible that there may be
such a thing as authority even in regard to our beliefs; that
it is quite within the range of possibilities that there should
be such a relation between the human soul and an infinite
Creator as to require the creature to accept by faith whatever
a proved revelation requires that intelligent creature
to believe. But, in view of the fact that what is specially
called revealed religion is addressed to an intelligent creature,
to whom the revelation itself must be proved by some
evidence that will satisfy the mind, there is an evident necessity
for treating the rationality of a belief in God as an
independent question. In some way, by some process, we
must reach a belief in the existence of a being before we
can consider the claims of a message which that being is
supposed to have sent to us. What we have to work with,
before we can approach the teaching of what is called revealed
religion, is the mind of man and the material universe.
Do these furnish us with the rational basis for a belief
in God?</p>

<p>And here I shall be expected to say what I mean by a
belief in God. I have neither so little reverence for what
I myself believe in, nor so little respect for my readers,
as to offer them anything but the common conception of
God. All that is necessary for me to do, in order to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
my own mind in contact with that of the reader, is to express
my conception of God just as it would be expressed
by any one who is accustomed to think of the being called
God by the Christian, the Jew, the Mohammedan, or by
some other branches of the human race. These different
divisions of mankind may differ in regard to some of the
attributes of the Deity, or his dealings with men, or the
history or course of his government of the world. But
what is common to them all is a belief in God as the Supreme
Being, who is self-existing and eternal, by whose will
all things and all other beings were created, who is infinite
in power and wisdom and in goodness and benevolence.
As an intellectual conception, this idea of a Supreme Being,
one only God, who never had a beginning and can
have no end, and who is the creator of all other beings, excludes,
of course, the polytheism of the ancient civilized
nations, or that of the present barbarous tribes; and it especially
excludes the idea of what the Greeks called Destiny,
which was a power that governed the gods as well as
the human race, and was anterior and superior to Jove
himself. The simple conception of the one God held by
the Christian, the Jew, or the Mohammedan, as the First
Cause of the universe and all that it embraces, creating all
things and all other beings by his will, in contrast with
the modern idea that they came into existence without the
volition of a conscious and intelligent being making special
creations, is what I present to the mind of the reader.</p>

<p>This idea of God as a matter of belief presents, I repeat,
a question of moral probabilities. The existence of
the universe has to be accounted for somehow. We can
not shut out this inquiry from our thoughts. The human
being who never speculates, never thinks, upon the origin
of his own soul, or upon the genesis of this wondrous
frame of things external to himself, or upon his relations
to some superior being, is a very rare animal. If he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
much more than an animal, he will have some idea of these
things; and the theories by which some of the most cultivated
and acute intellects of our race, from the widest
range of accumulated physical facts and phenomena yet
gathered, have undertaken to account for the existence of
species without referring them to the volition of an infinite
creator, are at once a proof of the universal pressure of the
question of creation upon the human mind, and of the logical
necessity for treating it as a question dependent upon
evidence and probability.</p>

<p>I lay out of consideration, now, the longing of the human
mind to find a personal God and Creator. This sentiment,
this yearning for an infinite father, this feeling of
loneliness in the universe without the idea of God, is certainly
an important moral factor in the question of probability;
but I omit it now from the number of proofs, because
it is a sentiment, and because I wish to subject the
belief in God as the Creator to the cold intellectual process
by which we may discover a conformity between that hypothesis
and the phenomena of Nature as a test of the
probable truth. If such a conformity can be satisfactorily
shown, and if the result of the process as conducted can
fairly claim to be that the existence of God the Creator has
by far the highest degree of probability above and beyond
all other hypotheses that have been resorted to to account
for our existence, the satisfaction of a moral feeling of the
human heart may well become a source of happiness, a consolation
in all the evils of this life, and a support in the
hour of death.</p>

<p>But in this preliminary chapter I ought to state what I
understand to be the scientific hypothesis or hypotheses
with which I propose to contrast the idea of God as the
creator of species by applying the test of probability. To
discuss the superior claims of one hypothesis over another,
without showing that there is a real conflict between them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
would be to set up a man of straw for the sake of knocking
it down as if it were a living and real antagonist. What
I desire to do is not to aim at a cheap victory by attacking
something that does not call for opposition; but it is to
ascertain first whether there is now current any explanation
or hypothesis concerning the origin of the creation, or anything
that it contains, which rejects the idea of God as the
creator of that which we know to exist and as it exists, and
then to ascertain which of the two hypotheses ought to be
accepted as the truth, because it has in its favor the highest
attainable amount of probability. There is an amount of
probability which becomes to us a moral demonstration, because
our minds are so constituted that conviction depends
upon the completeness with which the evidence in favor of
one hypothesis excludes the other from the category of rational
beliefs.</p>

<p>I pass by the common sort of infidelity which rejects
the idea of an intelligent creator acting in any manner
whatever, whether by special creations or by laws of development
operating on some primordial form of animal life.
But among the modern scientists who have propounded
explanations of the origin of species, I distinguish those
who do not, as I understand, deny that there was an intelligent
Creator by whose will some form of animal life was
originally called into being, but who maintain that the
diversified forms of animal life which we now see were not
brought into being by the special will of the Creator as we
now know them, but that they were evolved, by a process
called natural selection, out of some lower type of animated
organism. Of this class, the late Mr. Darwin is a representative.
There is, however, at least one philosopher who
carries the doctrine of evolution much farther, and who, if
I rightly understand him, rejects any act of creation, even
of the lowest and simplest type of animal existence. This
is Mr. Herbert Spencer&mdash;a writer who, while he concurs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Mr. Darwin's general theory of natural selection as the process
by which distinct organisms have been evolved out of
other organisms, does not admit of any primal organism
as the origin of the whole series of animals and as the creation
of an intelligent will.</p>

<p>It will be appropriate hereafter to refer to the doctrine
of evolution as a means of accounting for the existence of
the human mind. At present it is only necessary to say
that I understand it to be maintained as the hypothesis
which has the highest attainable amount of evidence in its
favor, that distinct species of animals are not a creation but
a growth; and also that the mind of man is not a special
creation of a spiritual existence, but a result of a long process
by which organized matter has slowly worked itself
from matter into intellect. Wherever, for instance, these
scientists may place the non-human primate, out of which
man has been evolved by what is called natural selection,
and whether they do or do not assume that he was a creation
of an intelligent will, they do not, as I understand,
claim that the primate was endowed with what we call intellect;
so that at some time there was a low form of
animal life without intellect, but intellect became evolved
in the long course of countless ages, by the process of natural
selection, through the improving conditions and better
organization of that low animal which had no intellect. In
other words, we have what the scientist calls the non-human
primate, a low form of animal without intellect, but capable
of so improving its own physical organization as to create
for itself and within itself that essence which we recognize
as the human mind. Here, then, there is certainly a theory,
an hypothesis, which may be and must be contrasted
with the idea that the mind of man is a spiritual essence
created by the volition of some other being having the
power to create such existences, and put into a temporary
union with a physical organization, by the establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of a mysterious connection which makes the body the
instrument of the soul so long as the connection exists.
If I have stated correctly the theory which assigns the origin
of the human mind to the process of evolution, I have
assuredly not set up a man of straw. I stand confronted
with an hypothesis which directly encounters the idea that
the human intellect is a creation, in the sense of a direct,
intelligent, conscious, and purposed production of a special
character, as the human mind and hand, in the production
of whatever is permitted to finite capacities, purposely creates
some new and independent object of its wishes, its desires,
or its wants. The human mind, says the scientist,
was not created by a spiritual being as a spiritual existence
independent of matter, but it grew out of matter, that was
at first so organized that it did not manifest what we call
intellect, but that could so improve its own organization as
to evolve out of matter what we know as mind.</p>

<p>And here I lay out of view entirely the comparative dignity
of man as a being whose existence is to be accounted
for by the one hypothesis or the other, because this comparative
dignity is not properly an element in the question
of probability. The doctrine of evolution, as expounded by
Darwin and other modern scientists, may be true, and we
shall still have reason to exclaim with Hamlet, "What a
piece of work is man!"</p>

<p>On the other hand, the hypothesis that man is a special
creation of an infinite workman, if true, does not enhance
the mere <i lang="la">a priori</i> dignity of the human race. It may, and
it will hereafter appear that it does, establish the moral accountability
of man to a supreme being, a relation which,
if I correctly understand the doctrine of evolution, is left
out of the system that supposes intellect to be evolved out
of the improving process by which matter becomes nervous
organization, whose action exhibits those manifestations
which we call mind. The moral accountability of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
man to a supreme being may, if it becomes established
by proper evidence, be a circumstance that distinguishes
him from other animals, and may, therefore, raise him in
the scale of being. But then this dignity is a fact that
comes after the process of reasoning has shown the relation
of creator and creature, and it should not be placed at
the beginning of the process among the proofs that are to
show that relation. Mr. Darwin, in concluding his great
work, "The Descent of Man," which he maintains to have
been from some very low type of animated creature, through
the apes, who became our ancestors, and who were developed
into the lowest savages, and finally into the civilized
man, has anticipated that his theory will, he regrets to say,
be "highly distasteful to many"; and he adds, by way of
parrying this disgust, that "he who has seen a savage in
his native land will not feel much shame if forced to acknowledge
that the blood of some more humble creature
flows in his veins." For his own part, he adds, he would
as soon be descended from a certain heroic little monkey
who exposed himself to great danger in order to save the
life of his keeper, as from a savage who delights to torture
his enemies, offers bloody sacrifices, practices infanticide,
etc. Waiving for the present the question whether the
man who is called civilized is necessarily descended from
or through the kind of savage whom Mr. Darwin saw in the
Tierra del Fuego, or whether that kind of savage is a deteriorated
offshoot from some higher human creatures that
possessed moral and intellectual characteristics of a more
elevated nature, I freely concede that this question of the
dignity of our descent is not of much logical consequence.
However distasteful to us may be the idea that we are descended
from the same stock as the apes, and that their direct
ancestors are to be traced to some more humble creature until
we reach the lowest form of organized and animated matter,
the dignity of our human nature is not to be reckoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
among the probabilities by which our existence is to be accounted
for. It is, in this respect, like the feeling or sentiment
which prompts us to wish to find an infinite creator,
the father of our spirits and the creator of our bodies. As
a matter of reasoning, we must prove to ourselves, by evidence
that satisfies the mind, that God exists. Having
reached this conviction, the belief in his existence becomes
a vast and inestimable treasure. But our wish to believe in
God does not help us to attain that belief. In the same
way our feeling about the dignity of man, the nobleness or
ignobleness of our descent from or through one kind of
creature or another, may be a satisfaction or a dissatisfaction
after we have reached a conclusion, but it affords us no
aid in arriving at a satisfactory conclusion from properly
chosen premises.</p>

<p>And here, in advance of the tests which I shall endeavor
to apply to the existence of God and the existence of man
as a special creation, I desire to say something respecting
the question of a logical antagonism between science and
religion. I have often been a good deal puzzled to make
out what those well-meaning persons suppose, who unwarily
admit that there is no necessary antagonism between what
modern science teaches and what religion teaches. Whether
there is or is not, depends upon what we mean by science
and religion. If by science we understand the investigation
of Nature, or a study of the structure and conditions of
everything that we can subject to the observation of our
senses, and the deduction of certain hypotheses from what
we observe, then we must compare the hypotheses with the
teachings or conclusions which we derive from religion.
The next question, therefore, is, What is religion? If we
make it to consist in the Mosaic account of the creation,
or in the teachings of the Bible respecting God, we shall
find that we have to deal with more or less of conflict between
the interpretations that are put upon a record sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>posed
to have been inspired, and the conclusions of science.
But if we lay aside what is commonly understood by revealed
religion, which supposes a special communication
from a superior to an inferior being of something which
the former desires the latter to know, after the latter has
been for some time in existence, then we mean by religion
that belief in the existence of a superior being which we
derive from the exercise of our reasoning powers upon
whatever comes within the observation of our senses,
and upon our own intellectual faculties. In other words,
for what we call natural religion, we look both outward
and inward, in search of a belief in a Supreme
Being. We look outward, because the whole universe
is a vast array of facts, from which conclusions are to
be drawn; and among this array of facts is the construction
of our bodies. We look inward, because our own
minds present another array of facts from which conclusions
are to be drawn. Now, if the conclusions which the
scientist draws from the widest observation of Nature, including
the human mind itself, fail to account for the existence
of the mind of man, and natural religion does account
for it, there is an irreconcilable conflict between science
and religion. I can not avoid the conviction that Mr. Darwin
has missed the point of this conflict. "I am aware,"
he says, "that the conclusions arrived at in this work will
be denounced by some as highly irreligious; but he who
denounces them is bound to show why it is more irreligious
to explain the origin of man, as a distinct species by descent
from a lower form, through the laws of variation and natural
selection, than to explain the birth of the individual
through the laws of ordinary reproduction." I do not understand
him, by the terms "religious" or "irreligious,"
to refer to anything that involves praise or blame for adopting
one hypothesis rather than another. I suppose he
meant to say that a belief in his theory of the descent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
man as a species is no more inconsistent with a belief in
God than it is to believe that the individual is brought
into being through the operation of the laws of ordinary
reproduction which God has established. This would be
strictly true, if the hypothesis of man's descent as a distinct
species from some lower form accounted for his existence
by proofs that satisfy the rules of evidence by which
our beliefs ought to be and must be determined. In that
case, there would be no inconsistency between his hypothesis
and that to which natural religion conducts us.
On the other hand, if the Darwinian hypothesis fails to
establish a relation between the soul of man, as a special
creation, and a competent creator, then the antagonism between
this hypothesis and natural religion is direct, immediate,
and irreconcilable; for the essence of religion consists
in that relation, and a belief in that relation is what we
mean, or ought to mean, by religion.</p>

<p>There is another form in which Mr. Darwin has depreciated
the idea of any antagonism between his theory and
our religious ideas, but it has the same logical defect as the
suggestion which I have just considered, because it involves
the same assumption. It is put hypothetically, but it is still
an assumption, lacking the very elements of supreme probability
that can alone give it force. "Man," he observes,
"may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen,
not through his own exertions, to the very summit of the
organic scale; and the fact of his having so risen, instead
of being aboriginally placed there, may give him some hope
for a still higher destiny in the distant future." I certainly
would not misrepresent, and I earnestly desire to understand,
this distinguished writer. It is a little uncertain
whether he here refers to the hope of immortality, or of an
existence after the connection between our minds and our
bodies is dissolved, or whether he refers to the further elevation
of man on this earth in the distant future of terres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>trial
time. If he referred to the hope of an existence after
what we call death, then he ought to have shown that his
theory is compatible with such a continued existence of the
soul of man. It will be one of the points on which I propose
to bestow some attention, that the doctrine of evolution
is entirely incompatible with the existence of the
human soul for one instant after the brain has ceased to act
as an organism, and death has wholly supervened; because
that doctrine, if I understand it rightly, regards the intellect
of man as a high development of what in other animals
is called instinct, and instinct as a confirmed and inherited
habit of animal organism to act in a certain way. If this
is a true philosophical account of the origin and nature of
intellect, it can have no possible individual existence after
the organ called the brain, which has been in the habit of
acting in a certain way, has perished, any more than there
can be a digestion of food after the stomach or other assimilating
organ has been destroyed. If, on the contrary,
the mind of man is a special creation, of a spiritual essence,
placed in an intimate union with the body for a temporary
period, and made to depend for a time on the organs of
that body as its means of manifestation and the exercise of
its spiritual faculties, then it is conceivable that this union
may be severed and the mind may survive. Not only is
this conceivable, but, as I shall endeavor hereafter to show,
the proof of it rises very high in the scale of probability&mdash;so
high that we may accept it as a fact, just as confidently
as we accept many things of which we can not have absolute
certainty.</p>

<p>And here I think it needful, although not for all readers,
but for the great majority, to lay down as distinctly as
I can the rules of evidence which necessarily govern our
beliefs. I do so because, in reading the works of many of
the modern scientists who have espoused the Darwinian
doctrine of evolution, I find that the rules of evidence are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
but little observed. There is a very great, often an astonishingly
great, accumulation of facts, or of assumed facts.
It is impossible not to be impressed by the learning, the industry,
and the range of these writers. Nor would I in the
least impugn their candor, or question their accuracy as
witnesses of facts, which I am not competent to dispute if
I were disposed to do so. But there is one thing for which
I may suppose myself competent. I have through a long
life been accustomed to form conclusions upon facts; and
this is what every person does and must do who is asked to
accept a new theory or hypothesis of any kind upon any
subject.</p>

<p>Most of our beliefs depend upon what is called circumstantial
evidence. There are very few propositions which
address themselves to our belief upon one direct and isolated
proof. We may class most of the perceptions of our
senses among the simple and unrelated proofs which we
accept without hesitation, although there is more or less of
an unconscious and instantaneous process of reasoning,
through which we pass before the evidence of our senses is
accepted and acted upon. Then there are truths to which
we yield an instant assent, because they prove themselves,
as is the case with the mathematical or geometrical problems,
as soon as we perceive the connection in the steps of
the demonstration. Besides these, there are many propositions
which, although they involve moral reasoning, have
become axioms about which we do not care to inquire, but
which we assume to have been so repeatedly and firmly
established that it would be a waste of time to go over the
ground again whenever they come up. But there is a
very large class of propositions which address themselves
to our belief, which do not depend on a single perception
through our senses, and are not isolated facts, and are not
demonstrable by mathematical truth, and are not axioms
accepted because they were proved long ago, and have by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
general consent been adopted into the common stock of
ideas. The class of beliefs with which the rules of circumstantial
evidence are concerned are those where the truth
of the proposition, or hypothesis, is a deduction from
many distinct facts, but the coexistence of which facts
leads to the inevitable conclusion that the proposition or
hypothesis is true. We can not tell why it is that moral
conviction is forced upon us by the coexistence of certain
facts and their tendency to establish a certain conclusion.
All we know is, that our minds are so constituted that we
can not resist the force of circumstantial evidence if we
suffer our faculties to act as reason has taught them. But,
then, in any given case, whether we ought to yield our
belief in anything where we have only circumstantial evidence
to guide us, there are certain rules to be observed.
The first of these rules is, that every fact in a collection of
proofs from which we are to draw a certain inference must
be proved independently by direct evidence, and must not
be itself a deduction from some other fact. This is the
first step in the process of arranging a chain of moral evidence.
There is a maxim in this branch of the law of
evidence that you can not draw an inference from an inference.
In other words, you can not infer a fact from
some other fact, and then unite the former with two or
more independent facts to make a chain of proofs. Every
link in the chain must have its separate existence, and its
existence must be established by the same kind and degree
of evidence as if it were the only thing to be proved. The
next rule is to place the several facts, when so proved, in
their proper relation to each other in the group from which
the inference is to be drawn. In circumstantial evidence a
fact may be established by the most direct and satisfactory
proofs, and yet it may have no relation to other facts with
which you attempt to associate it. For example, suppose
it to be proved that A on a certain occasion bought a cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>tain
poison, and that soon after B died of that kind of
poison; but it does not appear that A and B were ever
seen together, or stood in any relation to each other. The
fact that A bought poison would have no proper relation
to the other fact that B died of that kind of poison. But
introduce by independent evidence the third fact, that A
knew B intimately, and then add the fourth fact, that A
had a special motive for wishing B's death, you have some
ground for believing that A poisoned B, although no human
eye ever saw the poison administered. From this correlation
of all the facts in a body of circumstantial evidence,
there follows a third rule, namely, that the whole collection
of facts, in order to justify the inference sought to be
drawn from them, must be consistent with that inference.
Thus, the four facts above supposed are entirely consistent
with the hypothesis that A poisoned B. But leave out the
two intermediate facts, or leave out the last one, and B
might as well have been poisoned by C as by A. Hence
there is a fourth rule: that the collection of facts from
which an inference is to be drawn must not only be consistent
with the probable truth of that inference, but they
must exclude the probable truth of any other inference.
Thus, not only must it be shown that A bought poison,
that B died of poison, that A was intimate with B and had
a motive for wishing B's death, but, to justify a belief in
A's guilt, the motive ought to be shown to have been so
strong as to exclude the moral probability that B was poisoned
by some one else, or poisoned himself. It is in the
application of these rules that in courts of justice the minds
of jurymen often become perplexed with doubts which they
can not account for, or else they yield a too easy credence
to the guilt of the accused when the question of guilt depends
upon circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>I shall not spend much time in contending that these
rules of evidence must be applied to scientific investigations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
which are to affect our belief in such a proposition as the
descent of man from a common ancestor with the monkey.
This is not only an hypothesis depending upon circumstantial
evidence, but it is professedly a deduction from a great
range of facts and from a very complex state of facts. In
reasoning upon such subjects, when the facts which constitute
the chain of circumstantial evidence are very numerous,
we are apt to regard their greater comparative number
as if it dispensed with a rigid application of the rules of determination.
Every one can see, in the illustration above
employed, borrowed from criminal jurisprudence, that the
facts which constitute the chain of circumstantial evidence
ought to be rigidly tested by the rules of determination before
the guilt of the accused can be safely drawn as a deduction
from the facts. But, in reasoning from physical facts
to any given physical hypothesis where the facts are very
numerous, there is a strong tendency to relax the rules of
evidence, because, the greater the accumulation of supposed
facts becomes, the greater is the danger of placing in the
chain of evidence something that is not proved, and thus of
vitiating the whole process. To this tendency, which I have
observed to be very frequent among scientists, I should apply,
without meaning any disrespect, the term invention.
A great accumulation of facts is made, following one another
in a certain order; all those which precede a certain intermediate
link are perhaps duly and independently proved,
and the same may be the case with those which follow that
link. But there is no proof of the fact that constitutes the
link and makes a complete chain of evidence. This vacuity
of proof, if one may use such an expression, is constantly occurring
in the writings of naturalists, and is often candidly
admitted. It is gotten over by reasoning from the antecedent
and the subsequent facts that the intermediate facts
must have existed; and then the reasoning goes on to draw
the inference of the principal hypothesis from a chain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
proof in which a necessary intermediate link is itself a mere
inference from facts which may be just as consistent with
the non-existence as with the existence of the supposed
intermediate link. In such cases we are often told very
frankly that no one has yet discovered that the intermediate
link ever actually existed; that the researches of science
have not yet reached demonstrative proof of the existence
of a certain intermediate animal or vegetable organization;
that geological exploration has not yet revealed to us all the
specimens of the animal or vegetable kingdoms that may
have inhabited this globe at former periods of time; but
that the analogies which lead down or lead up to that as
yet undiscovered link in the chain are such that it must
have existed, and that we may confidently expect that the
actual proof of it will be found hereafter. The difficulty
with this kind of reasoning is that it borrows from the main
hypothesis which one seeks to establish the means of showing
the facts from which the hypothesis is to be drawn as
an inference. Thus, for example, the hypothesis is that
the species called man is a highly developed animal formed
by a process of natural selection that went on for unknown
ages among the individuals descended from the progenitor
of the anthropomorphous apes. The facts in the physical
organization and mental manifestations of the animal called
man, when viewed historically through all the conditions
in which we know anything of this species, lead up to that
common supposed ancestor of the apes. The facts in the
physical organization and instinctive habits of the ape,
when viewed historically through all the conditions in
which we know anything of his species, show that he, too,
was evolved by the process of natural selection out of that
same ancestor. Intermediate, respectively, between the
man and the monkey and their primordial natural-selection
ancestor or predecessor, there are links in the chain
of proof of which we have no evidence, and which must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
be supplied by inferring their existence from the analogies
which we can trace in comparing things of which
we have some satisfactory proof. Thus, the main hypothesis,
the theory of natural selection as the explanation
of the existence of distinct species of animals, is not
drawn from a complete chain of established facts, but it
is helped out by inferring from facts that are proved
other facts that are not proved, but which we have reason
to expect will be discovered hereafter. I need not say
that this kind of argument will not do in the common
affairs of life, and that no good reason can be shown why
our beliefs in matters of science should be made to depend
upon it.</p>

<p>We do not rest our belief in what is called the law of
gravitation upon any chain of proof in which it is necessary
to supply a link by assuming that it exists. The theory
that bodies have a tendency to approach each other, that
the larger mass attracts to itself the smaller by a mysterious
force that operates through all space, is a deduction from
a great multitude of perpetually recurring facts that are
open to our observation, no one of which is inferred from
any other fact, while the whole excludes the moral probability
that any other hypothesis will account for the phenomena
which are continually and invariably taking place
around us.</p>

<p>This illustration of the rules of evidence, when applied
to scientific inquiries, leads me to refer to one of the
favorite postulates of the evolution school. We are often
told that it ought to be no objection to the doctrine of
evolution that it is new, or startling, or contrary to other
previous theories of the existence of species. We are reminded
again and again that Galileo's grand conception was
scouted as an irreligious as well as an irrational hypothesis,
and that the same reception attended the first promulgation
of many scientific truths which no intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and well-informed person now doubts.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Then we have it
asserted that the doctrine of evolution is now accepted by
nearly all the most advanced and accomplished natural
philosophers, especially those of the rising scientists who
have bestowed most attention upon it. Upon this there
are two things to be said: First, it is a matter of very
little consequence that the learned of a former age did not
attend to the proofs of the law of gravitation, or of any
other new theory of physics, as they should have done, and
that they consequently rejected it. Their logical habits of
mind, their preconceived religious notions, and many other
disturbing causes, rendered them incapable of correct reasoning
on some particular subject, while they could reason with
entire correctness on other subjects. Secondly, the extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to which a new theory is accepted by those whose special
studies lead them to make the necessary investigations,
does not dispense with the application of the laws of evidence
to the facts which are supposed to establish the
theory. The doctrine of evolution addresses itself not
only to the scientific naturalist, but to the whole intelligent
part of mankind. How is one who does not belong to this
class of investigators to regulate his belief in the theory
which they propound? Is he to take it on their authority?
or is he, while he accords to their statements of facts all
the assent which as witnesses they are entitled to expect
from him, to apply to their deduction the same principles
of belief that he applies to everything else which challenges
belief, and to assent or dissent accordingly? No one, I
presume, will question that the latter is the only way in
which any new matter of belief should be approached. I
have not supposed that any scientist questions this; but I
have referred to the constant iteration that the doctrine of
evolution is now generally admitted by men of science,
that the assertion, supposing it to be true, may pass for just
what it is worth. It is worth this and no more: that
candid, truthful, and competent witnesses, when they speak
of facts that they have observed, are entitled to be believed
as to the existence of those facts. When they assume facts
which they do not prove, but which are essential links in
the chain of evidence, or when the facts which they do
prove do not rationally exclude every other hypothesis
excepting their own, the authority of even the whole body
of such persons is of no more account than that of any
other class of intelligent and cultivated men. In the ages
when ecclesiastical authority exercised great power over the
beliefs of men upon questions of physical science, the superiority
was accorded to the authority which claimed it,
and the scientist who propounded a new physical theory
that did not suit the theologian was overborne. It seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to me that it is a tendency of the present age to substitute
the authority of scientific experts in the place of the ecclesiastical
authority of former periods, by demanding that
something more than the office of witnesses of facts shall
be accorded to them. We are told that it is a very important
proof of the soundness of deductions, that the deductions
are drawn by the greater number of the specialists
who have examined the facts. Sometimes this is carried
so far as to imply presumption in those who do not yield
assent to the theory, as if it ought to be accepted upon the
authority of the experts whose proper office it is to furnish
us with the facts, and whose deductions we have to examine
upon the strength of their reasoning. Those of us who are
not professors of the particular science may be charged with
ignorance or incapacity if we do not join in the current of
scientific opinion. But, after all, the new theory challenges
our belief. If we examine it at all, we must judge of it,
not by the numbers of those who propound or accept it,
or by any amount of mere authority, but by the soundness
of the reasoning by which its professors support it.</p>

<p>The reader is now informed of what he may expect to
find discussed in this volume. It remains for me to indicate
the mode in which the discussion will be carried on.
I propose to divest my own mind, and so far as I may
to divest the mind of the reader, of all influence from revealed
religion. I shall not refer to the Mosaic account of
the creation excepting as I refer to other hypotheses. With
its authority as an account given by the Deity himself
through his chosen servant, I have here nothing to do.
Nor shall I rely upon the revelation recorded in the New
Testament. All the inquiries which I propose to make
are those which lie in the domain of natural religion;
and while I can not expect, in exploring this domain,
to make discoveries or to find arguments which can claim
the merit of originality, I may avoid traveling in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>well beaten
path, by pursuing the line of my own reflections,
without considering whether they coincide with or differ
from the reasonings of others. Although, at a former
period of my life, I have studied the great writers whose
speculations in the science of natural theology are the most
famous and important pieces in its literature, it is more
than forty years since I have looked into one of them; and
I do not propose to turn to them now, in order to see
whether they have or have not left any traces in my mind.
It is quite possible that critics may array against me the
authority of some great name or names; but even if I am
to be charged with presumption in entering upon this field,
it will not be found, so far as I am conscious, that I have
borrowed an argument, imitated a method, or followed an
example.</p>

<p>There is a passage in one of the writings of Lord Macaulay
in which that brilliant essayist maintained that
natural theology is not a progressive science. Macaulay's
tendency to paradox was often aggravated by the superficial
way in which he used his multifarious knowledge.
As in the course of this work I am about to do that which
he regarded as idle, namely, to inquire whether natural religion,
aside from revelation, is of any value as a means of
reaching a belief in the existence and attributes of God and
the immortality of man, I cite the passage in which Macaulay
makes the assertion that natural theology has made
no progress from the time of the Greek philosophers to the
present day: "As respects natural religion, revelation being
for the present altogether left out of the question, it is
not easy to see that a philosopher of the present day is
more favorably situated than Thales or Simonides. He has
before him just the same evidences of design in the structure
of the universe that the early Greeks had. We say just
the same, for the discoveries of modern astronomers and
anatomists have really added nothing to the force of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
argument which a reflecting mind finds in every beast, bird,
insect, fish, leaf, flower, and shell. The reasoning by which
Socrates in Xenophon's hearing confuted the little atheist
Aristophanes, is exactly the reasoning of Paley's 'Natural
Theology.' Socrates makes precisely the same use of the
statues of Polycletus and the pictures of Zeuxis which Paley
makes of the watch. As to the other great question, the
question what becomes of man after death, we do not see
that a highly educated European, left to his unassisted reason,
is more likely to be in the right than a Blackfoot Indian.
Not a single one of the many sciences in which we surpass
the Blackfoot Indians throws the smallest light on the
state of the soul after the animal life is extinct. In truth,
all the philosophers, ancient and modern, who have attempted
without the aid of revelation to prove the immortality
of man, from Plato down to Franklin, appear to us
to have failed deplorably.</p>

<p>"Then, again, all the great enigmas which perplex the
natural theologian are the same in all ages. The ingenuity
of a people just emerging from barbarism is quite sufficient
to propound those enigmas. The genius of Locke or Clarke
is quite unable to solve them. It is a mistake to imagine
that subtile speculations touching the Divine attributes,
the origin of evil, the necessity of human actions, the foundation
of moral obligation, imply any high degree of intellectual
culture. Such speculations, on the contrary, are
in a peculiar manner the delight of intelligent children and
of half-civilized men. The number of boys is not small
who, at fourteen, have thought enough on these questions
to be fully entitled to the praise which Voltaire gives to
Zadig: 'Il en savait ce qu'on a su dans tous les ages; c'est
à dire, fort peu de chose.'</p>

<p>"The book of Job shows that, long before letters and
arts were known to Ionia, these vexing questions were
debated with no common skill and eloquence under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
tents of the Idumean emirs; nor has human reason, in
the course of three thousand years, discovered any satisfactory
solution of the riddles which perplexed Eliphaz
and Zophar. Natural theology, then, is not a progressive
science."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Here, in the space of two not very long paragraphs, is
a multitude of allusions which evince the range of Lord
Macaulay's reading, but which are employed, without very
close thinking, in a quite inaccurate way, to sustain assertions
that are not true. If he had said that a modern philosopher
has before him in the structure of the universe not
only all the same evidence of design which the early Greeks
had, but a great deal more, he would have hit the exact
truth. It is simple extravagance to say that modern astronomy
has added nothing to the strength of the argument
which shows the existence of a supreme lawgiver and artificer
of infinite power and skill. What did the early Greeks
know about the structure of the solar system, the law of
universal gravitation, and the laws of motion? Compare
the ideas entertained by the Greek philosophers of the phenomena
of the universe with those which modern astronomy
has enabled a modern philosopher to assume as scientific
facts established by rigorous demonstration; compare
what was known before the invention of the telescope
with what the telescope has revealed; compare the progress
that was made in Greek speculative philosophy from the
time of Thales to the time of Plato, and then say whether
natural religion had not made advances of the greatest importance
even before modern science had multiplied the
means for still greater progress. A brief summary of the
Greek philosophy concerning the producing causes of phenomena
will determine whether Lord Macaulay was right
or wrong in the assertion that the "early Greeks" had as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
good means of making true deductions in natural theology
as the means which exist to-day.</p>

<p>All scholars who have attended to the history of Greek
speculation know that the Greeks held to the belief in polytheistic
personal agents as the active producers of the phenomena
of Nature. This was the system of Homer and
Hesiod and the other old poets. This was the popular belief
held throughout all the Hellenic world, and it continued
to be the faith of the general public, not only after the
different schools of philosophy had arisen, but down to and
after the time when St. Paul stood on Mars Hill and told
the men of Athens how he had found that they were in all
things too superstitious. Thales, who flourished in the
first half of the sixth century before Christ, was the first
Greek who suggested a physical agency in place of a personal.
He assumed the material substance, water, to be
the primordial matter and universal substratum of everything
in Nature. All other substances were, by transmutations,
generated from water, and when destroyed they all
returned into water. His idea of the earth was that it was
a flat, round surface floating on the immense watery expanse
or ocean. In this he agreed with the old poets; but
he did not, like them, suppose that the earth extended
down to the depths of Tartarus. The Thalesian hypothesis,
therefore, rejected the Homeric Okeanus, the father of
all things, and substituted for that personal agency the
agency of one primordial physical substance, by its own
energy producing all other substances. This is about all
that is known of the philosophy of Thales, and even this is
not known from any extant writing of his, but it is derived
from what subsequent writers, including Aristotle,
have imputed to him.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Why Lord Macaulay should have
selected Thales as the Greek philosopher who was as favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ably
situated as a philosopher of the present day for dealing
with questions of natural religion, is not very apparent. All
that Thales did, assuming that we know what he did, was
to strike out a new vein of thought, the direct opposite of
the poetical and popular idea of the origin of phenomena.</p>

<p>From Thales to Plato, a century and a half intervened.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
During this period there arose, according to Mr. Grote,
twelve distinct schemes of philosophy, the authors of which
that learned Englishman has enumerated, together with an
admirable summary of their respective systems. From this
summary certain things are apparent. All these philosophers,
from Thales to Democritus, while each speculated
upon Nature in an original vein of his own, endeavored to
find an explanation or hypothesis on which to account for
the production and generation of the universe by some
physical agency apart from the mythical personifications
which were believed in by the populace and assumed in the
poetical theologies. Some of them, without blending ethics
and theology in their speculations, adopted, as the universal
and sufficient agents, the common, familiar, and pervading
material substances, such as water, fire, air, etc.; others,
as Pythagoras and his sect, united with ethical and theological
speculations the idea of geometrical and arithmetical
combinations as the primal scientific basis of the phenomena
of Nature. But what was common to all these
speculations was the attempt to find a scientific basis on
which to explain, by physical generation, by transmutation
and motion from place to place, the generation of the Kosmos,
to take the place of generation by a divine personal
agency or agencies. But while these speculations were of
course unsuccessful, their abundance and variety, the inventive
genius which they exhibit, the effort to find a scientific
basis apart from the popular and poetic belief in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
multitude of personal and divine agencies, constitute, as
Mr. Grote has well said, "one of the most memorable facts
in the history of the Hellenic mind"; and "the mental
effort required to select some known agency and to connect
it by a chain of reasoning with the result, all this is a new
phenomenon in the history of the human mind." Such an
amount of philosophical speculations could not go on for a
century and a half without enlarging the means for dealing
with questions of natural theology; for they very nearly
exhausted the "causings and beginnings" which could be
assigned to regular knowable and predictable agencies; and
these they carried through almost every conceivable form of
action by which such agencies could be supposed to operate.
While the authors of these systems of philosophy were constantly
hampered by the popular and poetic conceptions of
a diversified and omnipresent polytheistic agency, a belief
which, as Mr. Grote has said, was "eminently captivating
and impressive," and which pervaded all the literature of
their time, their speculations accumulated a vast fund of
ideas in the sphere of scientific explanations, which, although
unsatisfactory to modern science, became, when we
reach Plato, the principal influence which led him to revert
to the former idea of a divine agency, intentionally and deliberately
constructing out of a chaotic substratum the system
of the Kosmos; and which also led him to unite with
it the idea of a mode in which it acted on and through the
primordial elements of matter.</p>

<p>So that, from the class of philosophers to whom Lord
Macaulay presumably referred as "the early Greeks," down
to and including Plato, there was a great advance. The
earlier Greek philosophers did not divide substance from its
powers or properties, nor did they conceive of substance as
a thing acted upon by power, or of power as a thing distinct
from substance. They regarded substance, some primordial
substance, with its powers and properties, as an efficient and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
material cause, and as the sole cause, as a positive and final
agent. They did not seek for a final cause apart from the
substances which they supposed to be the sole agents operating
to produce important effects. But, inasmuch as they
carried their various theories through nearly the whole range
of possible speculation, they enabled Plato and Aristotle to
see that there was a fundamental defect in their reasoning;
that there must be an abstract conception of power as something
distinct from substance or its properties. It was by
Plato and Aristotle that this abstract conception was reached,
of course without any influence of what we regard as revelation;
and, although they did not always describe correctly
the mode in which this power had acted, their perception
of the logical necessity for such a final cause marks a great
progress in philosophical speculation. It entirely refutes
Lord Macaulay's assertion that natural theology is not a
progressive science. It had made great progress from
Thales to Plato; and while in a certain sense it is true
that "a modern philosopher has before him just the same
evidence of design in the structure of the universe which
the early Greeks had"&mdash;that is, he has the same physical
phenomena to observe&mdash;it is not true that the early Greeks
did not develop conceptions of the origin of the universe
valuable to their successors. Lord Macaulay should not
have compared Thales with the modern philosopher, in respect
of advantage of situation, but he should have compared
the modern philosopher with Plato, and Plato with
his predecessors; and if he had done this, he could not have
asserted with any show of truth that natural theology has
made no advance as a science from the time of Thales,
the Milesian philosopher, and Simonides, the poet, to the
present day. I shall have occasion hereafter to speak of
the masterly intellectual power by which Plato wrought
out his conception of a formative divine agency in the production
of the Kosmos, and the bold and original specula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>tion
by which he avoided the charge of infidelity toward
the established religion of his countrymen.</p>

<p>When I come to speak of what modern astronomy has
done in furnishing us with new means of sound philosophical
speculation on the being, attributes, and methods
of God, it will be seen whether Lord Macaulay is correct
in the assertion that it has added nothing to the argument.
At present I will briefly advert to what the "early
Greeks," or any of the Greeks, knew of the structure of
the solar system. We learn, from a work which dates from
nearly the middle of the second century of the Christian
era, what was the general conception of the solar system
among the ancients, including the Greeks. This work is
known as the "Almagest" of Ptolemy, and the name of
the "Ptolemaic System" has been given to the theory
which he describes. This theory was common to all the
ancient astronomers, Ptolemy's statement of it being a
compendium of what they believed. Its principal features
are these: 1. The heavens are a vast sphere, in which the
heavenly bodies are set, and around the pole of this sphere
they revolve in a circle every day. 2. The earth is likewise
a sphere, and is situated in the center of the celestial
plane as a fixed point. The earth having no motion, and
being in the center of all the motions of the other bodies,
the diurnal revolutions of those bodies are in a uniform
motion around it. 3. The sun, being one of the heavenly
bodies making a revolution around the earth, was supposed
to be placed outside of the position of Venus in the heavenly
sphere. The order of the Ptolemaic system was thus:
The moon was first, being nearest to the earth; then came
Mercury and Venus, the sun being between Venus and
Mars. Beyond Mars came Jupiter and Saturn. Plato's
arrangement was in one respect different, his order being
the moon, the sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn. But this ideal heavenly sphere, with the earth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the center of all the revolutions of the other bodies, and
remaining quiescent&mdash;a theory which was common to all the
ancient astronomers&mdash;was the result of observing the motions
of the heavenly bodies as they appear to a spectator
on the earth. Such a spectator would have this appearance
of a celestial sphere presented to him wherever he
might be; and, judging from the apparent motions of the
heavenly bodies relative to his own position at the center,
he would conclude that the earth is at that center, and that
it remains at rest, supported on nothing. It required certain
discoveries to explode this system of a celestial sphere.
First came Copernicus, who, about the middle of the sixteenth
century of our era, published his demonstrations,
which convinced the world of two great propositions: 1.
That the diurnal revolution of the heavens is nothing but
an apparent motion, caused by the revolution of the earth
on its own axis. 2. That the earth is but one of a group
of planets, all of which revolve around the sun as a center.
Next came Kepler, who, in the early part of the seventeenth
century, recognizing the truth of the Copernican
system, determined the three laws of planetary motion: 1.
That the orbit of each planet is an ellipse, the sun being in
one focus. 2. That as each planet moves around the sun,
the line which joins it to the sun passes over equal areas in
equal times. 3. That the square of the time of a planet's
revolution around the sun is in proportion to the cube of
its mean distance from the sun. These laws were discovered
by Kepler as deductions made upon mathematical
principles from observations which had to be carried on
without the aid of the telescope, and without that knowledge
of the general laws of motion which came later. Kepler's
laws, although in the main correct, were subsequently
found to be subject to certain deviations in the planetary
motions. It was when Galileo, the contemporary of Kepler,
who, if he was not the first inventor of the telescope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
was the first to use it in astronomical observations, was able
by means of it to discover the general laws of motion, that
the substantial accuracy of Kepler's three laws could be
proved, while at the same time the deviations from them
were accounted for. Still, there was wanting the grand
discovery, which would disclose the cause of these motions
of the planets in elliptical orbits, and the relations between
their distances and their times of revolution, and thus reduce
the whole of the phenomena to a general law. Descartes,
who flourished 1596-1650, first attempted to do
this by his theory of Vortices. He supposed the sun to be
immersed in a vast fluid, which, by the sun's rotation, was
made to rotate in a whirlpool, that carried the planets
around with it, the outer ones revolving more slowly because
the parts of the ethereal fluid in which they were immersed
moved more slowly. This was a reversion back to
some of the ancient speculations. It was reserved for
Newton to discover the law of universal gravitation, by
which, in the place of any physical connection between the
bodies of the solar system by any intervening medium, the
force of attraction exerted by a larger body upon a smaller
would draw the smaller body out of the straight line that
it would pursue when under a projectile force, and would
thus convert its motion into a circular revolution around
the attracting body, and make the orbit of this revolution
elliptical by the degree in which the attracting force varied
in intensity according to the varying distance between the
two bodies. When Newton's laws of motion were discovered
and found to be true, the phenomena of the solar
system were explained.</p>

<p>It may be interesting, before leaving for the present this
branch of the subject, to advert more particularly to one of
the philosophical systems of the Greeks, which, when compared
with the discoveries of modern astronomy, illustrates
the great addition that has been made to our means of sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
speculation upon the origin of the material universe. I
refer to the system of the Pythagoreans&mdash;one of the most
remarkable instances of the invention of facts to fit and
carry out a theory that can be found in the history of philosophy,
although we are not without striking examples of
this practice in modern speculations. It has already been
seen that, during the whole period of Greek philosophy
before the time of Plato, the problem was to find a primordial
and universal agent by which the sensible universe was
built up and produced; supplying, that is to say, the matter
and force required for the generation of successive
products.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It has been seen that the Thalesian philosophers
undertook to solve this problem by the employment
of some primordial physical substance, such as water,
fire, air, etc. Pythagoras and his school held that the essence
of things consisted in number; by which they did
not mean simply that all things could be numbered, but
they meant that numbers were substance, endowed with an
active force, by which things were constituted as we know
them. In the Pythagorean doctrine number was the self-existing
reality; not, as in Plato's system of ideas, separate
from things, but as the essence or determining principles
of things, and having, moreover, magnitude and active
force.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This remarkably subtle conception of an agent in
the production of material things evinces the effort that
was making, in a direction opposite to that of Thales and
his immediate successors, to find a First Cause. It was
carried out by the Pythagoreans in the movements of the
heavenly bodies, in the works of human art, and in musical
harmony; in all of which departments, according to Mr.
Grote, they considered measure and number as the producing
and directing agencies. We are here concerned only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
with their application of this theory to the celestial bodies.
One of their writers is quoted by Mr. Grote as a representative
of the school which was founded by Pythagoras (about
530 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>), and which extended into the Græco-Italian
cities, where, as a brotherhood, they had political ascendency
until they were put down and dispersed about 509
<span class="smcap">B. C.</span>; but they continued for several generations as a social,
religious, and philosophical sect. According to this writer
(Philolaus), "the Dekad, the full and perfect number, was
of supreme and universal efficacy as the guide and principle
of life, both to the Kosmos and to man. The nature of
number was imperative and law-giving, affording the only
solution of all that was perplexing or unknown; without
number all would be indeterminate and unknowable."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Pythagoreans constructed their system
of the universe by the all-pervading and producing
energy of this primordial agent, Number, in the manner
thus described by Mr. Grote (i, 12-15): "The Pythagoreans
conceived the Kosmos, or the universe, as one single
system, generated out of numbers. Of this system the central
point&mdash;the determining or limiting One&mdash;was first in
order of time and in order of philosophical conception. By
the determining influence of this central constituted One,
portions of the surrounding Infinite were successively attracted
and brought into system: numbers, geometrical
figures, solid substances were generated. But, as the Kosmos
thus constituted was composed of numbers, there could
be no continuum; each numeral unit was distinct and separate
from the rest by a portion of vacant space, which was
imbibed, by a sort of inhalation, from the infinite space
or spirit without. The central point was fire, called by the
Pythagoreans the Hearth of the Universe (like the public
hearth or perpetual fire maintained in the prytaneum of a
Grecian city), or the watch-tower of Zeus. Around it revolved,
from west to east, ten divine bodies, with unequal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
velocities, but in symmetrical movement or regular dance.
Outermost was the circle of the fixed stars, called by the
Pythagoreans Olympus, and composed of fire like the center.
Within this came successively, with orbits more and more
approximating to the center, the five planets, Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, Venus, Mercury; next, the sun, the moon, and
the earth. Lastly, between the earth and the central fire,
an hypothetical body, called the Antichthon, or counter-earth,
was imagined for the purpose of making up a total
represented by the sacred number ten, the symbol of perfection
and totality. The Antichthon was analogous to a
separated half of the earth, simultaneous with the earth in
its revolutions, and corresponding with it on the opposite
side of the central fire. The inhabited portion of the earth
was supposed to be that which was turned away from the
central fire and toward the sun, from which it received
light. But the sun itself was not self-luminous: it was
conceived as a glassy disk, receiving and concentrating light
from the central fire, and reflecting it upon the earth, so
long as the two were on the same side of the central fire.
The earth revolved in an orbit obliquely intersecting that
of the sun, and in twenty-four hours, round the central fire,
always turning the same side toward that fire. The alternation
of day and night was occasioned by the earth being,
during a part of such revolution, on the same side of the
central fire with the sun, and thus receiving light reflected
from him; and during the remaining part of her revolution
on the side opposite to him, so that she received no light at
all from him. The earth, with the Antichthon, made this
revolution in one day; the moon, in one month; the sun,
with the planets Mercury and Venus, in one year; the planets
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn in longer periods respectively,
according to their distances from the center; lastly, the
outermost circle of the fixed stars (the Olympus, or the
Asslanes), in some unknown period of very long duration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"The revolutions of such grand bodies could not take
place, in the opinion of the Pythagoreans, without producing
a loud and powerful sound; and as their distances from
the central fire were supposed to be arranged in musical
ratios, so the result of all these separate sounds was full and
perfect harmony. To the objection, Why were not the
sounds heard by us? they replied that we had heard them
constantly and without intermission from the hour of our
birth; hence they had become imperceptible by habit."</p>

<p>Beautiful as was this theory&mdash;the origin of the phrase,
"the music of the spheres"&mdash;it owed its perfection as a
theory to a pure invention, resorted to in order to carry out
the hypothesis of the sacred number Ten, of which all the
greater numbers were only compounds and derivatives. This
perfect and normal Ten, as a basis on which to rest a bold
astronomical hypothesis, required the imagination of the
Antichthon, or counter-earth, in order, with the other bodies,
to make up the primordial number to whose generative
force the whole of these bodies owed their origin. The resort
to this conception of number, as a formative and active
agent, was doubtless due to the fact that the Pythagoreans
were the earliest cultivators of mathematical science. We
are told, in fact, that they paved the way for Euclid and
Archimedes, notwithstanding their symbolical and mystical
fancies, and from their mathematical studies they were led
to give exclusive supremacy to arithmetical and geometrical
views of Nature. But what is curious about this whole
speculation is, that in the invention or substitution of certain
facts in order to make a perfect theory, it resembles
some modern hypotheses, in which facts have been assumed,
or argued as existing from analogies, when there is no evidence
which establishes them. Modern instances of this
will appear hereafter.</p>

<p>Enough has now been said about the speculations of the
"early Greeks" to show the extravagance of Lord Macau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>lay's
assertion that the discoveries of modern astronomy
have placed the modern philosopher in no better situation
to make safe deductions in natural theology than that occupied
by the Hellenic philosophers from Thales to Plato.
The evidences of design in the formation of the solar system&mdash;of
that kind of design which acts in direct and specific
exertions of a formative will&mdash;have been enormously multiplied
by the discoveries of modern astronomy. Those discoveries,
instead of leaving us to grope among theories
which require the invention or imagination of facts, relate
to facts that are demonstrated; and they tend in the
strongest manner to establish the hypothesis of an infinite
Creator, making laws to govern material objects, and then
creating a system of objects to be governed by those laws.
In a future chapter I shall endeavor to show why this hypothesis
in regard to the solar system is most conformable
to the rules of rational belief.</p>

<p>Not to anticipate what will be said hereafter concerning
the modern discoveries in anatomy and in comparative
zoölogy, it is enough to say here that in the writings of the
Greek philosophers, especially of Plato and Aristotle, we
may discover what the Greeks knew or did not know, and
may therefore compare their knowledge with what is now
known. What was known about the human anatomy to
the Greeks of Plato's time is probably pretty well reflected
in his "Timæus," the celebrated dissertation in which he
developed his theory of the Kosmos; for, although Plato in
that superb philosophical epic made use of the organs of
the human body for ethical and theological purposes, and
did not make a special study of matters of fact, it is not
probable that in his mode of using them he so far departed
from the received ideas of his time respecting the human
anatomy that his treatise would have been regarded by his
contemporaries as an absurdity. Indeed, Mr. Grote considered
that Plato had that anatomical knowledge which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
an accomplished man of his time could hardly fail to acquire
without special study.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Moreover, even Galen, who
came five centuries after Plato, and whose anatomical knowledge
was far greater than could have been commanded in
Plato's day, was wholly wrong in respect to the functions
of some of the human organs. He agreed with Plato's
ethical view of the human organism, but not in his physiological
postulates. He considered, according to Mr. Grote,
that Plato had demonstrated the hypothesis of one soul to
be absurd; he accepted Plato's triplicity of souls, but he
located them differently. He held that there are three
"originating and governing organs in the body: the brain,
which is the origin of all the nerves, both of sensation and
motion; the heart, the origin of the arteries; the liver, the
sanguifacient organ, and the origin of the veins which distribute
nourishment to all parts of the body. These three
are respectively the organs of the rational, the energetic,
and the appetitive soul."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Plato, on the other hand, had
placed the rational soul in the cranium, the energetic soul
in the thoracic cavity, and the appetitive soul in the abdominal
cavity; he connected them by the line of the spinal
marrow continuous with the brain, making the rational
soul immortal, and the two inferior souls, or two divisions
of one inferior soul, mortal. Galen did not decide what is
the essence of the three souls, or whether they are immortal.
Plato assigned to the liver a very curious function, or
compound of functions, making it the assistant of the rational
soul in maintaining its ascendency over the appetitive
soul, and at the same time making it the seat of those
prophetic warnings which the gods would sometimes vouchsafe
to the appetitive soul, especially when the functions of
the rational soul are suspended, as in sleep, disease, or ecstasy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>But while there was much scientific progress from Plato
to Galen, and while Galen's physiological ideas of the functions
of the brain, the heart, and the liver held their place
until Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood in
the seventeenth century, that discovery and the subsequent
investigations proved that Galen, although not far wrong as
to the brain, was wholly wrong as to the liver, and partially
wrong as to the heart. Yet Galen's physiological theories
concerning these organs were founded on many anatomical
facts and results of experiments, such as could then be
made.</p>

<p>There is another fact which marks the state of anatomical
knowledge among the Greeks in the time of Plato, and
of Aristotle, who belonged to the same century. The
"Timæus" of Plato shows that there were physicians at
that period, and that he was acquainted with the writings
of Hippocrates. The important fact is, as stated by Mr.
Grote, that "the study and practice of medicine was at
that time greatly affected by the current speculations respecting
Nature as a whole; accomplished physicians combined
both lines of study, implicating cosmical and biological
theories."<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>It is now only needful to say that modern anatomy and
physiology afford aids to sound deductions in natural theology
in reference to the structure of the human body as an
animal organism, and all the functions of its different organs,
which immeasurably transcend all that was known or
assumed among the early Greeks, or in the time of Plato
and Aristotle, or in the time of Galen. Notwithstanding
the dispute whether the origin of man as an animal is to be
referred to a special act of creation, or to the process of
what has been called evolution, there can be no controversy
on one point, namely, that modern anatomy and physiology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
have vastly increased our knowledge of the structure of the
human frame, and the means of rational speculation upon
the nature of intellect, as compared with any means that
were possessed by the most accomplished and learned of the
Greeks of antiquity. It matters little on which side of the
controversy, between creation and evolution, the great anatomists
of the present day range themselves. It is upon
the facts which their investigations have revealed that we
have to judge of the probable truth of the one hypothesis
or the other. The probable destiny of man as an immortal
being is an inquiry that has certainly lost nothing by our
increased knowledge of the facts in his animal structure
which tend to support the hypothesis of design in his creation.</p>

<p>Lord Macaulay attributes an utter failure to the efforts
of the philosophers, from Plato to Franklin, to "prove"
the immortality of the soul without the help of revelation.
What did he mean by proof? Revelation is, of course, the
only direct proof. It is so, because it is direct testimony
of a fact, proceeding from the only source that can have
direct and certain knowledge of that fact. When the evidences
which are supposed to establish the existence and
authority of the witness have become satisfactory to us, we
are possessed of proof of our immortality, and this proof is
the only direct evidence of which the fact admits, and it
constitutes all that should be spoken of as proof. But there
is collateral although inferior evidence&mdash;inferior, because it
consists in facts which show a high degree of probability
that the soul of man is immortal, although this kind of
evidence is not like the direct testimony of a competent
witness. Is all this presumptive evidence, with its weighty
tendency to establish the probable truth of immortality, to
be pronounced of no value, because it belongs to a different
order of proof from that derived from the assertion of a
competent witness to the fact? It is one of the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of our situation in this life, that the collateral evidence
which tends to show the high probability of a future state
of existence is not withheld from us. As a supplemental
aid to the direct teaching of revelation, it is of inestimable
importance if we do not obscure it by theories which pervert
its force, and if we reason upon it on sound philosophical
principles. What we have to do in estimating the
probable truth of our immortality, as shown by the science
of natural religion, is to give the same force to moral evidence
in this particular department of belief, that we give
to the moral evidence which convinces us of many things
of which we have no direct proof, or of which the direct
proof lies in evidence of another kind.</p>

<p>"He knew as much about it," said Voltaire, "as has
been known in all ages&mdash;that is to say, very little indeed."
This, like many of the witticisms of Voltaire, pressed into
the service of an argument against the value of natural religion
at the present day when studied by mature and disciplined
minds, is quite out of place. What human reason
has done in the course of three thousand years is not to be
put on a par with the speculations of intelligent children
or half-civilized men; and although some of the riddles
which perplexed Eliphaz and Zophar have not had a perfectly
satisfactory solution, it is quite wide from the truth
to assert that there has been no approximation to a satisfactory
solution, or that some of the riddles have not ceased
to be the riddles which they were three thousand years ago.
In that period there has been an accumulation of evidence
concerning the phenomena of Nature, and the phenomena
of mind, vast beyond comparison when placed in contrast
with what was known in the tents of the Idumean emirs,
and the importance of this accumulation of evidence is
proved by the fact that theories have been built upon it
which undertake to explain it by hypotheses that were
never heard of before, and which may possibly leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
"riddles" in a far less satisfactory state than they were in
the time of Job. On the other hand, while the companions
of Job may have been unable to suggest to him any solution
of the problems of life, it does not at all follow that we are
as helpless as they were, even if we avail ourselves of nothing
but what the science of natural theology can now teach
us.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It will be seen that I attach great importance to natural
theology. But I do not propose to write for the confirmed
believers in revelation, on the one hand, who have become
convinced by the evidence which supports revelation; or for
those, on the other hand, who believe nothing, and who
have become confirmed in habits of thinking which unfit
them for judging of the weight of evidence on such subjects
as the existence of God and the creation of man. I
write for that great mass of people of average intelligence,
who do not understand accurately what the doctrine of
evolution is as expounded by its leading representatives,
and who do not know to what it leads. It will be found
that in some respects there is a distinction between the
school of which Darwin is the representative and the school
which follows Spencer. To point out this distinction, and
yet to show that both systems result in negatives which put
an end to the idea of immortality, and that the weight of
evidence is against both of them, is what I propose to do.</p>

<p class="intro">The Platonic Kosmos compared with the Darwinian theory of evolution.
</p>


<p>It is my purpose in this chapter to draw a parallel between
the theory of the origin of different animals propounded
in the "Timæus" of Plato and that of Mr. Darwin.
The analogy between them has been briefly hinted by Mr.
Grote, but he has not followed it out in detail, as it was no
part of his object to make minute comparisons between any
of the speculations of Plato and those of modern philosophers.
The great English scholar and critic seems to regard
it as somewhat uncertain how far Plato meant in the
"Timæus" to have his description of the Kosmos stand as an
expression of his own belief, or as a mere work of his imagination
and fancy. Plato, we are told, and this is quite obvious,
dealt but little with facts, while he dealt largely with
theories. But, even as a pure work of the imagination, or
as a philosophical epic, the daring conception of the Kosmos
is wonderfully complete; and it will repay any one, who
follows Mr. Grote in his analysis of it, to observe how Plato
employs a process of degeneration to account for the formation
of different species of animals, from the higher to the
lower, by agencies that bear a strong resemblance to those
which are assumed by Darwin to have worked in the opposite
process of variation and natural selection, resulting in
the evolution of a higher from a lower animal. But, in
order to render this comparison intelligible, it is necessary
to make an abstract of Plato's system of the Kosmos before
adverting to the analogies between that system and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Darwinian theory. I follow, although I have greatly condensed,
Mr. Grote's description of the Platonic Kosmos.</p>

<p>According to the Platonic idea of the Kosmos, as given
in the "Timæus," there existed, anterior to all time, primordial
matter in a state of chaos. This matter was not created
for; according to Mr. Grote, whose authority upon
such a point is the highest, the notion of absolute creation
was unknown to the Greeks of antiquity, and it does not
appear that Plato suggests it. But, without accounting for
its existence, Plato assumes that there was matter in a condition
of utter chaos before time could have had an existence;
and, in order to make the chaotic condition the more
impressive in its primitive destitution of all form or active
principles tending to union or arrangement, he supposes
that the four elements of fire, air, earth, and water had no
existence save in the abstract, or as ideas and forms. But,
as abstract ideas, these four elements of fire, air, earth, and
water were distinct, self-existing, and indestructible, coeval
with the chaotic matter which was waiting to receive their
impress and to take on their distinctive elemental characters.
They had already begun to act on the <i lang="la">fundamentum</i>,
or primordial chaotic matter, as upon a recipient, but it
was in a confused way and without regularity of plan, so
that they had not become concrete existences or determinate
agents.</p>

<p>In this state of things there appears upon the scene the
Demiurgus, a being coeval with the chaos of matter, that is,
self-existing and eternal. But, consistently with the philosophy
which did not admit of the idea of absolute creation,
the Demiurgus was not a creator, but an architect or
designer, working on materials that lay within his reach.
His moral attribute was goodness, which was, in his situation,
synonymous with order, regularity, symmetry, and
proportion, and, along with this tendency, he had supreme
artistic skill. In other words, he was the personification of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
νους, or reason, working against necessity: the latter being,
not what we mean by that term, something preordained
and fixed, but confusion, uncertainty, irregularity, and unreason,
which are to be overcome by their opposites.</p>

<p>Besides the chaotic matter and the ideas or forms of the
four elements, as yet unrealized in the actual substances of
fire, air, earth, and water, there were coeval ideas or forms
of animals, or, as we should say, abstract animals, or conceptions
of animals. The first and grandest of these was
the eternal self-animal, or the ideal of animal existence.
Next came the ideas or forms of four other animals: 1. The
celestial gods; 2. Man; 3. Birds, or animals living in air;
4. Land or water animals. Bearing in mind that we are
still in the region of abstract conceptions in regard to these
types of animals, which as yet have no concrete existence,
and that they are, so to speak, the intellectual models from
which the Demiurgus is to work, in order to make the real
animals conformably to the pre-existing and eternal plan,
we come to the process of forming the Kosmos, which is to
be the containing animal of all the other four. Out of the
confused chaos of existing matter the Demiurgus proceeds
to construct the Kosmos, which was to become the one self-animal,
by impressing the idea or abstract form of animal
upon a physical structure built out of the primordial chaotic
matter and comprehending the whole of it. The first
step was to bring the four elements of fire, air, earth, and
water out of their chaotic and confused condition by separating
them according to the forms of their eternal ideas.
The total of each element, when made to take its normal
form, was used in the construction of the Kosmos, which
thus came to possess the whole existing body of material;
"so that," to borrow the words of Mr. Grote, "there remained
nothing of the four elements apart, to hurt the
Kosmos from without, nor anything as raw material for a
second Kosmos."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>The Kosmos was made a perfect sphere, and with a perfectly
smooth outer surface, without organs of sight or
hearing, because there was nothing outside to be seen or
heard; without organs of respiration, because there was no
outside atmosphere to be breathed; and without nutritive
or excrementory organs, because it was self-sufficing, being
supplied with nourishment by its own decay. It was not
furnished with limbs or means of locomotion or standing,
because, being a sphere turning on an axis, and having only
one of the seven possible varieties of movement, namely,
rotation in a circle in one and the same plane, there was
nothing for it to grasp or repel.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This body, the only-begotten,
because in its formation all existing bodily material
was employed, perfectly spherical and smooth, equidistant
from its center to all points of its circumference, and suspended
upon its own axis traversing its diameter, was now
to be animated by a soul.</p>

<p>The Demiurgus, in the formation of the soul of the
Kosmos, took three constituent ingredients and mixed
them together. They were: 1. The Same, or the Identical,
the indivisible and unchangeable essence of Ideas; 2. The
Different, or the Plural, the divisible essence of bodies or of
the elements; 3. A compound of both of these ingredients
melted into one. Blended together in one grand compound,
these three ingredients formed the soul of the Kosmos by
first dividing the mixture into different portions, and then
uniting the portions according to a complicated scale of
harmonious numerical proportions. The outer or sidereal
sphere of the Kosmos was made to receive the Same, or
Identity, by being placed in an even and undivided rotation
toward the right, turning on the great axis of the
whole sphere. The interior, or planetary spheres, the five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
planets, and the sun and the moon, were made to be
under the influence of the Different, or Diversity&mdash;that is
to say, their rotations on their separate axes, all oblique,
were toward the left, while the overpowering force of
rotation of the outer sphere carried them along with it,
although the time of their separate rotations was more or
less modified by their own inherent and countermoving
forces.</p>

<p>Thus the sentient capacity of the cosmical soul became
the cognition of the Same and the Different, and the blended
Same and Different, because it embodied these three ingredients
in its own nature. It was invisible; rooted at
its center and pervading and inclosing the whole visible
body, circulating and communicating, without voice or
sound, all impressions and information concerning the
existing relations between the separate parts and specialties
of the cosmical body.</p>

<p>Anterior to the Kosmos there was no time. With the
rotation of the Kosmos time began. It was marked first
by the eternal and unchanging rotation of the outer circle,
in which were placed the fixed stars, which revolved with
it in unaltered position with regard to each other; and one
revolution of this outer or most rational circle made a day.
The sun, moon, and planets were distributed in different
portions of the Circle of the Different; one revolution of
the moon marking a month, and one revolution of the sun
marking a year. The earth, the first and oldest of the
sidereal and planetary gods, was packed around the great
axis which ran through the center of the Kosmos, and
turned that axis; so that the earth regulated the movement
of the great cosmical axis, and was the determining
agent of night and day.</p>

<p>Thus far we have the formation of the Kosmos, animated
with a pervading soul, the body being formed out of the
whole of existing matter, molded into the specific elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of fire, air, earth, and water, and the soul being formed out
of the constituent ingredients furnished by the eternal and
invisible essence of ideas. The whole, body and soul of the
Kosmos, was thus an animal, formed on the abstract but
eternal idea or form of an animal which had existed before
time began. We now approach the formation of the other
animals. Of the Kosmos there could be but one. All existing
material of matter had been used in his construction.
He could not become a species, as there could be no second
Kosmos. Something could be borrowed from him, for the
formation of other animals, but nothing could be destroyed.
He was not yet, however, a full copy of the model of the
Generic Animal or Idea of Animal, because the eternal
plan of that model required that he should be peopled or
inhabited by four other animals, which might constitute
species. Accordingly, the Demiurgus proceeds to form the
first of these sub-animals, the gods, who are to inhabit
different portions of the Kosmos. The first of these in
formation was the earth, planted in the center, and made
sentinel over night and day; next the fixed stars, formed
chiefly out of fire, and placed in the outer circle of a fixed
revolution, or the Circle of the Same, to give to it light
and brilliancy. The sidereal orbs thus became animated
beings, eternal and divine. They remained constantly
turning round in the same relative position, but the sun,
moon, and planets, belonging to the Circle of the Different,
and trying to revolve by their own effort in a direction
opposite to that of the outer sphere, became irregular in
their revolutions and varied in their relative positions.
Thus the primitive gods were the earth and the fixed stars,
which revolved without variation with the Circle of the
Same, and became immortal as well as visible; while the
sun, moon, and planets were not among the primitive
gods, but were simply spherical bodies placed in the inner
Circle of the Different. The primitive gods preside over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and regulate the Kosmos. From them are generated and
descended the remaining gods.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Having completed the Kosmos and the primitive gods,
the Demiurgus paused in his work. There were still other
animals to be constructed, the first and noblest of which
was to be Man. But the Demiurgus, who, in the construction
of these gods, had made them immortal, not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
their own nature but through his determination, seems
to have apprehended that, if he proceeded to construct the
other animals himself, they would likewise be thereby rendered
of immortal duration. He therefore assembled the
newly generated gods and made to them a personal address.
He informed them of their immortal existence, and of his
purpose to confide to them the construction of the other
animals, stating at the same time, in the case of man, that
he would himself supply an immortal element which they
were to incorporate with a mortal body, in imitation of the
power which he had exercised in the generation of themselves.
He then proceeded to compound together, but in
inferior perfection and purity, the remnant of the same
elements out of which he had formed the cosmical soul.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
He then distributed the whole of this mass into souls equal
in number to the fixed stars, placed each of them in a star
of its own, where it would be carried round in the cosmical
rotation, explained to it its immortal destiny, and that
at an appointed hour of birth it would be transferred into
a mortal body in conjunction with two inferior kinds of
soul or mind. These irrational enemies, the two inferior
souls, the rational and immortal soul would have to control
and subdue, so as to live a good life. If it triumphed
in the conflict, it would return after death to its own star,
where in an everlasting abode it would dwell forever in
unison with the celestial harmonies and perfections of the
outer sphere. But, if it failed, it would be born again into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
an inferior body, and on the death of that body, if it continued
evil, it would be again born into a still more degraded
animal, through an indefinite transmigration from
animal to animal, until the rational soul should have obtained
the mastery over the irrational and turbulent, when
it would be released and permitted to return to its own
peculiar star.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Here, then, the Demiurgus retired, leaving
to the gods the work of fabricating mortal bodies for man,
and two mortal and inferior souls, with which the immortal
soul was to be joined. But before he withdrew he inculcated
upon the gods to construct the new mortal animal
in the best manner, so that the immortal soul should have
the fairest chance of guiding and governing rightly, in
order that the animal might not be the cause of mischief
and misery to himself; a possible and even probable result
which the Demiurgus proclaimed beforehand, thus relieving
himself of responsibility, and casting it, it would seem,
upon the gods.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The latter stood, then, in the position of
workmen, who have received certain directions from a
superior architect, have been supplied with certain materials,
and are obliged to conform to a prescribed model, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
cosmical animal, as far as circumstances will allow. The
Demiurgus retires, and leaves the gods to their work.</p>

<p>They borrow from the Kosmos, from which they are
permitted to obtain materials, portions of the four elements,
for the construction of the human body, with an
engagement that these materials shall one day be returned.
These they unite in one body by numerous minute and
invisible fastenings; over this body they place a head or
cranium, into which they introduce the immortal soul,
making the head, with its spherical form like that of the
Kosmos, and admitting of no motion but the rotary, the
most divine portion of the human system and master of
the body, which is to be subject and ministerial. To the
body they give all the six varieties of motive power, forward,
backward, upward, downward, to the right and to
the left. The phenomena of nutrition and sensation begin
as soon as the connection is formed between the immortal
soul and the mortal body, but as the irregular movements
and agitations arising from the diverse rotations of the
Same and the Different convey false and foolish affirmations
to the soul in the cranium. That soul is destitute of intelligence
when first joined to the body, and remains so for
some time. But gradually these disturbing currents abate,
the rotations of the Same and the Different in the head
become more regular, and the man becomes more intelligent.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to account for the introduction of
the two mortal souls, and to show how the conflict appointed
for the immortal soul became the test of a life
which was to determine whether the latter should be permitted,
on the death of the body, to return to its peculiar
star, or whether it should be degraded into some lower
form of animal. The immortal soul has its special abode
in the head, which is both united to and separated from
the trunk by the neck. The gods kept the two mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
souls separate, so that the rational or immortal soul might
be defiled by the contact as little as possible. The better
portion of the mortal soul they placed in the thoracic
cavity. It was the energetic, courageous, contentious soul,
placed above the diaphragm, so as to receive orders easily
from the head, and to aid the rational soul in keeping the
mutinous soul of appetite, which was placed below the
diaphragm, in subjection.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow here the minute anatomical
descriptions which Plato gives of the different organs of
the human body, or of the way in which they are supposed
to act on the two divisions of the mortal soul, or to be
acted on by them, or the mode in which the latter act
upon the encephalic or immortal soul which is seated in
the cranium. These descriptions evince much knowledge
of the human anatomy, and probably all the knowledge
that was possessed in Plato's time. It is immaterial how
far this anatomical knowledge was correct, and of course
there was in Plato's use of the various organs a great deal
that was fanciful. It is sufficient, without following Mr.
Grote's analysis through these details, to note that, in
Plato's arrangement, the immortal soul was supposed to be
fastened in the brain, the two mortal souls in the line of
the spinal marrow continuous with the brain, and that this
line formed the thread of connection between them all.</p>

<p>Passing on toward the point where the process of degradation
might begin, which would result in the reduction
of this new and divinely constructed animal to a lower
form, we have to note, first, that it was made a non-sexual
animal, being intended for an angelic type. In the original
plan of the gods, it was not contemplated that this
primitive type should reproduce itself by any process of
generation. According to the original scheme, it would
seem that every time a new immortal soul was to be
brought down from its peculiar star, the process of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>structing
for it a mortal body would have to be repeated.
Plato, Mr. Grote observes, does indeed tell us that the
primitive non-sexual type had the option of maintaining
itself. But this must mean that each individual of that
type had the option of maintaining itself in its struggle
with the debasing influences of appetite and disease. But
not one representative of it has held his ground; and as it
was foreseen that such an angelic type could not maintain
itself, we are to look for a reconstruction of the whole
organism. This came about from the degeneracy of the
primitive non-sexual animal below the standard of good life
which it had the option of continuing. Men whose lives
had fallen below this standard became effeminate, cowardly,
unjust. In their second birth, their immortal souls had to
be translated into a body resembling that to which they had
debased the first body into which they were born. The first
transition, therefore, was from man into woman. In other
words, the gods, seeing that the non-sexual primitive type
did not maintain itself at the high point intended for it,
reconstructed the whole organism upon the bi-sexual principle,
introducing the comparatively lower type of woman.
A partial transformation of the male structure makes the
female. A suitable adjustment of the male organs, and
the implanting of the sexual impulse in both sexes, by the
agency of the gods, make provision for generative reproduction,
and a species is formed, which takes the place of
the primitive non-sexual type which did not reproduce itself
in the original scheme. The primitive type disappears, and
it disappears by a process of degradation, which it undergoes
by reason of its failure to avail itself of the option
which it originally had of living a good life that would entitle
the immortal soul to return to its peculiar star without
further conflict with the debasing tendencies to which
it was exposed in the first body that it inhabited.</p>

<p>In this curious theory we see how a process of declen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>sion
or degradation is induced by what may almost be
called a choice, since the primitive human being, by not
resisting the debasing tendencies of his lower nature, is
made by those tendencies to assume a less divine form than
that in which he originally existed. To the primitive man
the gods assigned the encephalic or head-soul, which was
connected with and suspended from the divine soul of the
Kosmos. They assigned it to each man as his presiding
genius. If he neglected it, and directed all his development
toward the energetic or appetitive mortal soul, he
would become debased. He did so. Hence it became
necessary for the gods to reconstruct the whole organism,
and in this reconstruction the primitive non-sexual type becomes
the bi-sexual, and a species is formed.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enter into the metaphysical argument
which relates to the question of responsibility for this
change from the original plan. Plato tells us that the
gods foresaw it as a necessary consequence of the original
scheme; and, moreover, that they foresaw that they must
make preparation for the still more degenerate varieties of
birds and quadrupeds, into which the corrupt and stupid
part of mankind would sink, all of which were according
to the great eternal scheme of the four kinds of ideal
animals embraced in the idea of the Kosmos itself. But
with the moral justice of the whole theory we have no concern
here. We are here concerned, first, with the nature of
the process by which, in the Platonic theory, the bi-sexual
human race became formed out of the primitive non-sexual
type; and, next, with the process by which individuals of
this race became degraded into the lower animals.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>After the process of degradation had begun, after the
primitive type had given place to the bi-sexual human race,
and a species was thus formed, further degradation would
be inevitable under the same causes which produced the first
one. The female part of mankind would go on bringing
forth new males and new females, and to each one at birth
there would come from its peculiar star an immortal soul,
for I do not understand that Plato's women were supposed
not to be constructed, in this respect, upon the same plan
as the men. But each of these newly arrived immortal
souls would be placed in a mortal body in contact and conflict
with the two mortal souls of appetite, disturbance, and
mutiny against the divine laws of reason. Each new human
being would then be exposed to further debasement, by
which his or her human organs and human form would
undergo transformation into a lower type of animal life.
Accordingly, we find that Plato, in perfect consistency with
his theory, supposes that birds are a degraded birth or
formation derived from one peculiar mode of degeneracy in
man, hair being transmuted into feathers and wings. If
we inquire from what kind of men the birds were formed,
and how they came to be assigned to the air, we shall best
learn from the words employed by Mr. Grote to express
Plato's idea: "Birds were formed from the harmless but
light, airy, and superficial men, who, though carrying their
minds aloft to the study of cosmical phenomena, studied
them by visual observation and not by reason, foolishly
imagining that they had discovered the way of reaching
truth."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Next to the birds came the land-animals, a more brutal
formation. These, to borrow the words of Mr. Grote's
analysis, "proceeded from men totally destitute of philoso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>phy,
who neither looked up to the heavens nor cared for
celestial objects; from men making no use whatever of the
rotations of their encephalic soul, but following exclusively
the guidance of the lower soul in the trunk. Through such
tastes and occupations, both their heads and their anterior
limbs became dragged down to the earth by the force of
affinity. Moreover, when the rotation of the encephalic
soul from want of exercise became slackened and fell into
desuetude, the round form of the cranium was lost and became
converted into an oblong or some other form. These
now degenerated into quadrupeds and multipeds, the gods
furnishing a greater number of feet in proportion to the
stupidity of each, in order that its approximation to earth
might be multiplied. To some of the more stupid, however,
the gods gave no feet or limbs at all, constraining them
to drag the whole length of their bodies along the ground,
and to become reptiles. Out of the most stupid and senseless
of mankind, by still greater degeneracy, the gods
formed fishes, or aquatic animals&mdash;the fourth and lowest
genus after men, birds, land-animals. This race of beings,
from their extreme want of mind, were not considered
worthy to live on earth, or to respire thin and pure air.
They were condemned to respire nothing but deep and turbid
water, many of them, as oysters and other descriptions
of shell-fish, being fixed down at the lowest depth or bottom.
It is by such transitions (concludes the Platonic
'Timæus') that the different races of animals passed originally,
and still continue to pass, into each other. The interchange
is determined by the acquisition or loss of reason
or rationality."<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have a process of degradation by which
the different races of animals were formed, by a kind of
selection which, commencing in the human species from the
neglect of the encephalic soul to maintain its high duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and aims, goes on in successive debasements which result in
the formation of lower and still lower animals until we reach
the shell-fish fixed upon the earth at the bottom of the
water. The bi-sexual principle of construction having been
introduced in the human species, was continued through
all the other species formed by the still descending process
of deterioration, so that to each successive species there remained
the power of reproducing its own type, along with
the tendency to evolve a lower type by further loss of reason
or rationality. It is not material to the purpose of the
parallel, which I am about to draw between the Platonic and
the Darwinian system, to consider the precise nature of the
Platonic idea of an intelligent power, by which these successive
degradations were in one sense purposely ordained.
Enough is apparent on the Platonic system to show that,
while these degradations were according to an eternal plan,
because they resulted from the conflict between reason and
unreason, order and disorder, between purity and impurity,
yet the different species of animals, after man, were not
special creations by an infinite power interfering in each
case by a separate exercise of creative will. They were a
growth of an inferior organization out of a superior through
the inevitable operation of tendencies which changed the
forms of the animals. As fast as these tendencies operated&mdash;and
they were continually operating&mdash;the ministers of the
Demiurgus, the gods, stood ready to adapt the structure to
the new conditions in which the tendencies resulted, so
that the new animal might be fitted to and fixed in those
conditions. Still, the gods are not represented as making
separate creations of new species as an act of their will,
without the pre-existing operation in the preceding type of
tastes and occupations which modify the structure into one
of a more degraded character. It may thus be said with
entire truth that the Platonic idea of the origin of the different
races of animals presents a parallel to the Darwinian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
theory, in which it will be found that the one is the reverse
of the other, both of them proceeding upon and involving
analogous principles of evolution, operating in the one system
from below upward, and in the other from a higher
point downward. If, in the Platonic system, the idea of
an original immortal soul placed in a heavenly abode, but
afterward brought down and fixed in a mortal body, is the
starting-point&mdash;if a conflict of a spiritual and angelic existence
with corporeal and earthly tendencies is at first the
predominant fact&mdash;the parallel between the Platonic process
of degradation and the Darwinian process of elevation
remains the same; for, in the one system, reason degenerates
into instinct, and instinct at last reaches its lowest possible
action, or ceases entirely; and, in the other, instinct
rises from its lowest action through successive improvements
until it becomes mind or intellect: so that somewhere
in the two processes there must be a point where
they pass each other in opposite directions, the one losing
or merging intellect in instinct, the other losing and merging
instinct in mind, each of the two processes being a process
of development or evolution, but in opposite directions.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It is not easy to ascertain at once what was Mr. Darwin's
idea of the mode in which a supreme intelligence has
presided over the creation. In his work on "The Descent
of Man", he adduces some evidence that man was not
"originally endowed with the ennobling belief in the existence
of an Omnipotent God," this evidence being that numerous
savage races have existed, and still exist, who have
had and have no words in their language to express this
idea. But this, if true, does not help us to understand
what part in Mr. Darwin's theory an Omnipotent God is
supposed to play. Scattered through the same work we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
find references to the hypothesis of such a being, and to the
influences which this belief has exerted upon the advance of
morality. But I assume that we are to understand that Mr.
Darwin adopts as a fact, to be taken into account in judging
of his theory of evolution, that there is such a being as
an Omnipotent God, having equally the power to make
separate creations, or to establish certain laws of matter, and
to leave them to operate through secondary causes in the
production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants
of the world. In his work on the "Origin of Species"
he refers to "what we know of the laws impressed upon
matter by the Creator."<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In his "Descent of Man" the
following passage occurs toward the close of the work:
"He who believes in the advancement of man from some
low organized form will naturally ask, How does this bear
on the belief in the immortality of the soul? The barbarous
races of man, as Sir J. Lubbock has shown, possess no
clear belief of this kind; but arguments, derived from the
primeval beliefs of savages, are, as we have just seen, of
little or no avail. Few persons feel any anxiety from the
impossibility of determining at what precise period in the
development of the individual, from the first trace of a
minute germinal vesicle, man becomes an immortal being;
and there is no greater cause for anxiety, because the period
can not possibly be determined in the gradually ascending
organic scale."</p>

<p>Surely it is a most pertinent inquiry, How does his theory
of the advancement of man from some lower organized
form bear on the immortality of the soul? and it is no answer
to this inquiry to say that upon no hypothesis of man's
origin can we determine at what precise period he becomes
an immortal being. That the idea of an Omnipotent God,
capable of creating a spiritual essence, or an immortal soul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
is not denied by Mr. Darwin, is doubtless to be inferred
from his strong affirmation that our minds refuse to accept
as the result of blind chance the grand sequence of events
which the birth both of the species and the individual
presents to our view. That variations of structure, the
union of pairs in marriage, the dissemination of seeds, and
similar events, have all been ordained for some special purpose,
is the hypothesis according to which he regards them
as events brought about by the laws of natural selection,
which laws were ordained by the Creator and left to operate.
Now, while this hypothesis excludes, or tends to exclude,
the idea of blind chance, it still remains to be considered
whether the soul of man, or the essence which we call intellect,
is in each case a direct creation of a special character,
or whether it is a result from the operation of the laws
which have been ordained for the action of organized matter.
If it is the former, the soul may survive the destruction
of the body. If it is the latter, the soul as well as all the
other manifestations or exhibitions which the material body
gives forth in its action, may and in all probability must
cease with the organs whose action leads us falsely to believe
that we are animated by an immortal spirit while we
are in the flesh. If it is a necessary result of any theory
that what is supposed to be the immortal soul of man is a
product of the operation of certain laws imposed upon organized
matter, without being a special creation of something
distinct from matter, it is immaterial whether the
organized form of matter with which the soul is connected,
or appears to act for a time, was a special creation, or was
an evolution out of some lower form, or came by blind
chance. Nor is it material that we can not determine at
what precise period in the genesis of the individual, by the
ordinary process of reproduction, he becomes an immortal
being. The question is, Does he ever become an immortal
being, if in body and in mind he is a mere product of or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>ganized
matter, formed from some lower type through the
laws of variation and natural selection, resulting in an
animal whose manifestations or exhibitions of what we call
intellect or mind are manifestations of the same nature as
the instincts of the lower animals, differing only in degree?</p>

<p>That I may not be misunderstood, and especially that I
may not be charged with misrepresentation, I will state the
case for the Darwinian theory as strongly as I can. The
question here is obviously not a question of power. An
Omnipotent Creator has just the same capacity to make
special creations, by a direct and special exertion of his
will, as he has to make one primordial type and place
it under fixed laws that will in their operation cause a
physical organization to act in such a way as to evolve
out of it other and more or less perfect types. In either
method of action, he would be the same Omnipotent God,
by whose will all things would exist; and I assume that
upon this point there is no difference between some of
the evolution school and its opponents. But in considering
the question of the origin of the human soul, or the intellect
of man, we are dealing not with a question of power,
but with the probable method in which the conceded Omnipotent
capacity has acted. On the one hand, we have
the hypothesis that the Eternal and Omnipotent capacity
has created a spiritual and immortal being, capable of existing
without any union with the body that is formed out
of earthly material, but placed for a time in unison with
such a body; and that for the effectual purpose of this
temporary union this body has been specially constructed,
and constructed in two related forms, male and female, so
that this created species of animal may perpetuate itself by
certain organic laws of reproduction. Now it is obviously
immaterial that we can not detect the point of time, or the
process, at or by which the union between the spiritual
essence and the earthly body takes place in the generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of the individual. It is conceded to be alike impossible
to detect the time or mode in which descendants of the
lower animals, which had nothing resembling intellect,
become endowed with and inhabited by intellect, through
the supposed laws of variation and natural selection, operating
to produce an animal of a more elaborate organization.
The point of divergence between the two hypotheses is precisely
this: that the one supposes the mind of man to be a
special creation, of a spiritual nature, designed to be immortal,
but placed in union with a mortal body for a temporary
purpose. The other hypothesis supposes no special
creation of either the mind or the body of man, but maintains
that the latter is evolved out of some lower animal,
and that the former is evolved out of the action of physical
organization.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Either mode of projecting and executing
the creation of both the body and the mind of man is of
course competent to an Omnipotent God. The question is,
Which mode has the highest amount of probability on which
to challenge our belief? If the one, as it is described,
leads to the conclusion that the mind can not survive the
body, and the other leads to the conclusion that it can, we
are left to choose between them: and our choice must be
determined by what we can discover of satisfactory proof
that the mind of man was destined to become immortal.
What, then, is the Darwinian theory of the origin of man as
an animal, and to what does it lead respecting the origin
and nature of the human soul?</p>

<p>Whoever will carefully examine Mr. Darwin's hypothe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>sis
of the descent of man as an animal, will find that commencing
at a point opposite to that at which Plato began
his speculations, the modern naturalist assumes the existence
of a very low form of animated and organized matter,
destitute of anything in the nature of reason, even if
acting under what may be called instinctive and unconscious
impulses, imposed upon it by the preordained laws
by which animated matter is to act. By some process of
generation, either bi-sexual or uni-sexual or non-sexual, this
very low type of animal is endowed with a power of reproducing
other individuals of the same structure and habits.
In process of time, for which we must allow periods
very much longer than those of which we are accustomed
to think in relation to recorded history, the individuals of
this species become enormously multiplied. A struggle for
existence takes place between these very numerous individuals;
and in this struggle there comes into operation the
law to which Mr. Darwin has given the name of "natural
selection," which is but another name for a series of events.
He does not mean by this term to imply a conscious choice
on the part of the animals, nor an active power or interfering
deity. He employs it to express a constantly occurring
series of events or actions, by which, in certain circumstances,
animals secure themselves against the tendency to
destruction which is caused by the great disparity between
their numbers and the amount of food that is accessible to
them, or by the unfavorable influences of a change of climate
upon so great a body of individuals. He calls this
series of events or actions <em>natural</em> selection, in order, as I
understand, to compare what takes place in nature with
what takes place when a breeder of animals purposely selects
the most favorable individuals for the purpose of improving
or varying the breed. In nature, the selection is
supposed to operate as follows: The strongest and most
active individuals of a species of animals have the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
chance of securing the requisite amount of food from the
supply that is insufficient for all. They do this by their
greater fleetness in overtaking the common prey, or by making
war upon the more feeble or inactive of their fellows;
and numerous individuals are either directly destroyed by
this warfare, or are driven off from the feeding-ground and
perish for want of nourishment. Thus the best specimens
of the race survive; and to this occurrence is given the name
of the "survival of the fittest," meaning the survival of those
individuals best fitted to continue their own existence and
to continue their species. A physical change in the country
inhabited by a great multitude of individuals of a certain
species, or by different species&mdash;for example, a change of climate&mdash;operates
to make this struggle for existence still more
severe, and the result would be that those individuals of the
same species which could best adapt themselves to their new
condition would tend to be preserved, as would the different
species inhabiting the same country which could best
maintain the struggle against other species. The improvement
in the structure of the animals takes place, under this
process of natural selection, in the following manner: The
best individuals being preserved, the organs of which they
make most use in the struggle for existence undergo development
and slight modifications, favorable to the preservation
of the individual, and these modifications are transmitted
to their offspring. Here there comes in play a kind
of collateral aid to which is given the name of "sexual
selection," which is defined as a form of selection depending
"not on a struggle for existence in relation to other
organic beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle
between individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the
possession of the other sex."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> "The result," continues
Mr. Darwin, "is not death to the unsuccessful competitor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less
rigorous than natural selection. Generally, the most vigorous
males, those which are best fitted for their place in
nature, will leave most progeny. But, in many cases, victory
depends not so much on general vigor, as on having
special weapons, confined to the male sex." As, by means
of this warfare of sexual selection, the victor would always
be allowed to breed, his courage and his special weapons of
offense or defense, in their increased development, would
descend to his offspring. Thus the improvement and
modification induced by natural selection would be enhanced
and transmitted by the sexual selection.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the operation of the two kinds of selection
in the evolution of man from a lower form of animal, we
find the theory to be this: That organic beings with
peculiar habits and structure have passed through transitions
which have converted the primordial animal into one
of totally different habits and structure; that, in these
transitions, organs adapted to one condition and mode of
life have become adapted to another; that such organs are
homologous, and that in their widely varied uses they have
been formed by transitional gradations, so that, for example,
a floating apparatus, or swim-bladder, existing in a
water-animal for one purpose&mdash;flotation&mdash;has become converted
in the vertebrate animals into true lungs for the
very different purpose of respiration. Thus, by ordinary
generation, from an ancient and unknown prototype, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
only have organs, by minute and successive transitions, become
adapted to changed conditions of life, but the whole
organism has become changed, and this has resulted in the
production of an animal vastly superior to his ancient and
unknown prototype; and yet to that prototype, of which we
have no specimen and no record, are to be traced the germs
of all the peculiarities of structure which we find in the perfect
animals of different kinds that we thoroughly know,
until we come to man, these successive results being brought
about by the two kinds of selection&mdash;natural and sexual.</p>

<p>There can be no better illustration of the character of
Mr. Darwin's theory than that to which he resorts when
he means to carry it to its most startling length, while he
candidly admits that he has felt the difficulty of this application
of it far too keenly to be surprised at the hesitation
of others. This illustration is the eye. Here he very
justly says it is indispensable that reason should conquer
imagination; but on which side of the question reason or
imagination is most employed might, perhaps, be doubtful.
Mr. Darwin's hypothesis concerning the eye begins
with the fact that in the highest division of the animal
kingdom, the vertebrata, we can start from an eye so simple
that it consists, as in the lancelet,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of a little sack of
transparent skin, furnished with a nerve, and lined with
pigment, but destitute of any other apparatus. From this
prototype of a visual organ, up to the marvelous construction
of the eye of man or of the eagle, he supposes that extremely
slight and gradual modifications have led, by the
operation of natural and sexual selection; and by way of
illustrating this development, he compares the formation
of the eye to the formation of the telescope. "It is
scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye with a tele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>scope.
We know that this instrument has been perfected
by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects,
and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed
by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference
be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that
the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?
If we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we
ought, in imagination, to take a thick layer of transparent
tissue, with spaces filled with fluid, and with a nerve sensitive
to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this
layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to
separate into layers of different densities and thickness,
placed at different distances from each other, and with the
surface of each layer slowly changing in form. Further,
we must suppose that there is a power, represented by
natural selection or the survival of the fittest, always
watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers,
and carefully preserving each which, under varied circumstances,
in any way or in any degree, tends to produce a
distincter image. We must suppose each new state of the
instrument to be multiplied by the million, each to be preserved
until a better one is produced, and then the old ones
to be all destroyed. In living bodies variations will cause
the slight alterations, generation will multiply them almost
infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with unerring
skill each improvement. Let this process go on for millions
of years, and during each year on millions of individuals
of many kinds, and may we not believe that a living optical
instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of
glass as the works of the Creator are to those of man?"<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It might have occurred to the very learned naturalist
that the formation of a mechanical instrument by the hand
of man, guided by his intellect, admits of varieties of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
instrument for different purposes, as products of an intelligent
will. Different kinds of telescopes for different uses
have been produced, not by destroying the poorer ones and
preserving the better ones, but by a special and intentional
adaptation of the structure to special uses, until an instrument
is made which will dissolve the nebulæ of the milky
way, and bring within the reach of our vision heavenly
bodies of the existence of which we had no previous knowledge.
Why may not the same intelligent and intentional
formation of the human eye, as a special structure adapted
to the special conditions of such an animal as man, have
been the direct work of the Creator, just as the lowest
visual organ&mdash;that of such a creature as the lancelet&mdash;was
specially made for the conditions of its existence? Why
resort to the theory that all the intermediate varieties of
the eye have grown successively out of the lowest form of
such an organ by transitional grades of which we can not
trace the series, when the probabilities concerning the
varieties of this organ of which we have any knowledge are
so strongly on the side of a special and intentional adaptation
of each one to the circumstances of the animal to
which it has been given? As a question of power in the
Creator, either method of action was of course just as competent
as the other. As a question of which was his probable
method, the case is very different; for we know comparatively
very little of the modifications produced by such
causes as natural or even sexual selection, while we may,
without presumption, assume that we know much more
about the purposes of special adaptation to special conditions,
which an omnipotent Creator may have designed and
effected. But this is a digression, and also an anticipation
of the argument.</p>

<p>To state the pedigree of man according to the Darwinian
theory, we must begin with an aquatic animal as the
early progenitor of all the vertebrata. This animal exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>ing,
it is assumed, "in the dim obscurity of the past," was
provided with branchiæ or gills, or organs for respiration
in water, with the two sexes united in the same individual,
but with the most important organs of the body, such as
the brain and heart, imperfectly or not at all developed.
From this fish-like animal, or from some of its fish descendants,
there was developed an amphibious creature, with the
sexes distinct. Rising from the amphibians, through a
long line of diversified forms, we come to an ancient marsupial
animal, an order in which the young are born in a
very incomplete state of development, and carried by the
mother, while sucking, in a ventral pouch.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> From the
marsupials came the quadrumana<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and all the higher mammals.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Among these mammals there was, it is supposed,
a hairy, tailed quadruped, probably arboreal in its habits,
from which man is descended. It was an inhabitant of
the Old World. It branched into the lemuridæ, a group
of four-handed animals, distinct from the monkeys, and
resembling the insectivorous quadrupeds in some of their
characters and habits;<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and from these came the simiadæ,
of which there were two great stems&mdash;the New World and
Old World monkeys. "From the latter, at a remote
period, man, the wonder and glory of the universe, proceeded."<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The reader must now, in order to do justice to this theory,
imagine a lapse of time, from the period of the existence
of the aquatic progenitor of all the vertebrata, to be
counted by millions of years, or by any figures that will
represent to the mind the most conceivable distance between
a past and a present epoch. Through this enormous
stretch of centuries, in order to give scope to the operation
of the laws of natural and sexual selection, we must suppose
the struggle for existence to be going on among the
individuals of the same species, and among different species
inhabiting the same country, and the sexual selection
among the individuals of the same species to be perpetually
transmitting to offspring the improved and more developed
organs and powers induced by natural selection; so that in
the countless sequence of generations there are evolved animals
that are so widely different from their remote progenitors
that in classifying them we find them to be new
species, endowed with a power of reproducing their own
type, and similarly capable, it would seem, of still further
development into even higher types in the long-distant
future.</p>

<p>I know not how it may appear to others, but to me the
parallelism between the Platonic and the Darwinian theory
is very striking. Both speculators assume the existence of
a Supreme Intelligence and Power, presiding over the
creation of animals which are to inhabit this earth. Behind
the celestial or primitive gods the Greek philosopher
places the Demiurgus, to whom the gods stand in the relation
of ministers or servants to execute his will. The
modern naturalist assumes the existence of the Omnipotent
God; and although he does not directly personify the
laws of natural and sexual selection which the Omnipotent
power has made to operate in nature, they perform an office
in the transitional gradations through which the animals are
successively developed, that very closely resembles the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
performed by the gods of Plato's system in providing the
modifications of structure which the animals undergo. In
the two processes the one is the reversed complement of
the other. Plato begins with the formation of an animal of
a very exalted type, and by successive degradations, induced
by the failure of the animal to live up to the high standard
of its rational existence, he supposes a descent into lower
and still lower forms, the gods all the while providing a
new structure for each successive lower form, until we
reach the shell-fish fixed on the earth beneath the water.
Darwin begins with the lowest form of animated organization,
and by successive gradations induced by the struggle
of the animal to maintain its existence, he supposes an ascent
into higher and still higher forms, the laws of natural
and sexual selection operating to develop a new structure
for each successive higher form, until we reach man, "the
wonder and glory of the universe," an animal whose immediate
ancestor was the same as the monkey's, and whose remote
progenitor was an aquatic creature breathing by gills
and floating by a swim-bladder.</p>

<p>Nor had Plato less of probability to support his theory
than Darwin had to support his. The Greek philosopher
might have adduced the constant spectacle of men debasing
their habits and even their physical appearance into a
resemblance to the brutes. He might have suggested, and
he does suggest, how the degrading tendencies of the lower
appetites and the ravages of disease drag down the human
frame from its erect carriage and its commanding power
over matter to an approximation with the condition of the
inferior animals. He might have adduced innumerable
proofs of the loss of reason, or rationality, through successive
generations of men, brought about by the transmission
of both appetites and physical malformation from parents
to children. He might have compared one of his Athenian
fellow-citizens of the higher class with the lowest savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
known throughout all the regions accessible to an observer
of his day and country. He might have portrayed the one
as a being preserving his physical organization in the highest
state of perfection by gymnastic exercises, by a well-chosen
diet, by observance of all the conditions of health,
by the aid of the highest medical skill known to the age;
cultivating his mind by philosophy, practicing every public
and private virtue as they were understood among a people
of rare refinement, and adorning his race by an exhibition
of the highest qualities that were then attainable. All
these qualities, physical, mental, and moral, Plato might
have shown were transmissible in some degree, and in a
good degree were actually transmitted from sire to son.
Turning to the other picture, and comparing "Hyperion
to the satyr," he might have shown that the lowest savage,
in those physical points of structure which were best
adapted to his animal preservation as an inhabitant of the
wildest portion of the earth, had retained those which
made him more nearly resemble the brute inhabitants of
the same region, and that in his intellectual and moral
qualities the resemblance between him and his Athenian
contemporary was almost wholly lost. Intermediate between
these extreme specimens of the human race, why
could not Plato have found with great probability, and
often with actual proof, successive degradations of structure
and uses of organs, just as well supported by facts, or
analogies, or hypotheses, as are Mr. Darwin's successive
elevations from a lower to a higher animal? If Plato had
known as much about the animal kingdom as is now known,
he could have arrayed the same facts in support of his theory,
by an argument as powerful as that which now supports
the doctrine of evolution.</p>

<p>Nay, it is certain that Plato's attention was drawn to
some of these facts, and that he makes use of them in a
way that is as legitimately a probable occurrence as any use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
that is made of them at the present day. For example, he
was struck with the existence of what in scientific parlance
are called "rudiments," a term that is employed to describe
an organ or part which appears to have no special use where
it is found in one animal, but which, in a more developed
or in a diversified condition, has an obvious use in another
animal. Thus, he tells us that the gods, with a long-sighted
providence, introduced a sketch or rudiment of
nails into the earliest organization of man, foreseeing that
the lower animals would be produced from the degeneration
of man, and that to them claws and nails would be absolutely
indispensable.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In the same way, he seems to regard
hair as a rudiment, relatively speaking; for while its
use on different parts of the body of man, or even on the
head, is not very apparent, its use to the lower animals is
very obvious. Why, then, is it not just as rational, and
just as much in accordance with proper scientific reasoning,
to suppose those parts of animal structure which are called
"rudiments" to have been introduced as mere sketches in
the organization of a very high animal, and then to have
been developed into special uses in lower animals produced
by the degeneration of the higher, as it is to suppose that
they were developed in full activity and use in the lower
animals, but sank into the condition of useless or comparatively
useless appendages as the higher animal was evolved
out of the lower by a process of elevation? The modern
naturalist of the evolution school will doubtless say that
"rudiments" in the human structure, for which there is
no assignable use that can be observed, are not to be accounted
for as sketches from which Nature was to work,
in finding for them a use in some other animal in a developed
and practically important condition; that, to the extent
to which such things are found in man, they are proofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of his cognate relations to the lower animals, in which they
have a palpable use; and that the gradations by which they
have proceeded from practical and important uses in the
lower animals, until they have become mere useless or
comparatively useless sketches in the human structure, are
among the proofs of the descent of man from the lower animals
which had a use for such things. I shall endeavor
hereafter to examine the argument that is derived from
"rudiments" more closely. At present, the point which
I suggest to the mind of the reader arises in the parallel
between the Platonic and the Darwinian theory of the origin
of the different species of animals. I ask, why is it not
just as probably a true hypothesis to suppose that man was
first created with these rudimentary sketches in his organization,
and that they became useful appendages in the lower
animals, into which man became degenerated, as it is to
suppose that these parts existed in full development, activity,
and practical use in the lower animals, out of whom
man was generated, and that in man they lost their utility
and became relatively mere rudiments? To my mind,
neither theory has the requisite amount of probability in
its favor compared with the probability of special creations;
but I can see as much probability in the Platonic as in the
Darwinian explanation, and a strong parallelism between
them.</p>

<p>I will pursue this parallel somewhat further by again
adverting to Plato's idea of the origin of the human soul.
He supposes it to have been an immortal being, formed out
of the eternal essence of Ideas by the Demiurgus. He
manifestly makes it an existence distinct from matter, because
he places its first abode in a heavenly mansion, where
it is in unison with the celestial harmonies and perfections
of the outer circle. This heavenly sphere is again to be its
abode, after it shall have been released from its temporary
abode on earth, which has been appointed to it for purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of discipline and trial. At a fixed time of birth it is brought
down from its celestial abode and united with a mortal body,
that it may assert and prove its power to preside over and
govern that body according to the eternal laws of reason
and rectitude. If it fulfills this high duty, when the fastenings,
which have bound it to the mortal frame, are dissolved
with the dissolution of those which hold together
the material structure, the soul flies away with delight to
its own peculiar star. If it fails in this high duty, it is on
the death of the first body transferred by a second birth
into a more degraded body, resembling that to which it has
allowed the first one to be debased. At length, somewhere
in the series of transmigrations, the lower and bestial tendencies
cease to have power over the immortal soul; the
animal with which it was last united remains an animal
bereft of reason, and the soul, released from further captivity,
escapes to its original abode in the heavens, more
or less contaminated by what it has undergone, but still
immortal, indestructible, spiritual, and capable of purification.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a conception of the origin and nature
of the human soul as a spiritual existence, quite as distinctly
presented as it can be by human reason. Stripped
of the machinery by which Plato supposes the soul to have
come into existence, his conception of its origin and nature
is the most remarkable contribution which philosophy, apart
from the aid of what is called inspiration, has made to our
means of speculating upon this great theme. Of course, it
affords, with all the machinery of which Plato makes use,
no explanation of the point or the time of junction between
the soul and the body. But, as a conception of what in
the poverty of language must be called the substance of the
soul, of its spiritual and immortal nature, of its distinctive
existence separate from what we know as matter, whether
Plato borrowed more or less from other philosophers who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
preceded him, it is a very distinct presentation of the nature
of the human mind.</p>

<p>Turn now to what can be extracted from the Darwinian
theory of the origin and nature of the human mind, and
observe where it holds with and where it breaks from the
parallelism between it and the Platonic theory. The doctrine
of evolution, so called, presents to us no distinct suggestion
that the mind of man is a separate and special creation.
Rejecting, and very properly rejecting, the Platonic
idea of an existence of the human soul anterior to the birth
of the individual, the Darwinian theory supposes that in
the long course of time, during which natural and sexual
selection were operating to produce higher and still higher
animals, there came about, in the earlier and primitive
organizations, a habit of the animal to act in a certain way;
that this habit descended to offspring; that it became
developed into what is now called instinct; and that instinct
became developed into what we now call mind. I know
not how otherwise to interpret Mr. Darwin's repeated
affirmations that, in comparing the mental powers of man and
those of the lower animals, there can be detected no difference
in kind, but that the difference is one of degree only;
that there is no fundamental difference, or difference in
nature, between the mental powers of an ape and a man, or
between the mental power of one of the lowest fishes, as a
lamprey or lancelet, and that of one of the higher apes;
that both of these intervals, that between the ape and man,
and that between the lancelet and the ape, which are much
wider in the latter case than in the former, are filled up by
numberless gradations.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> If this be true, it must be because
the lancelet, supposing that animal to be the progenitor,
formed a habit of acting by an implanted impulse,
which became, under the operation of natural and sexual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
selection, confirmed, developed, and increased in its descendants,
until it not only amounted to what is called instinct,
but took on more complex habits until something
akin to reason was developed. As the higher animals continued
to be evolved out of the lower, this approach to a
reasoning power became in the ape a true mental faculty;
and, at length, in the numberless gradations of structure
intermediate between the ape and the man, we reach those
intellectual faculties which distinguish the latter by an
enormous interval from all the other animals. "If," says
Mr. Darwin, "no organic being, excepting man, had possessed
any mental power, or if his powers had been of a
wholly different nature from those of the lower animals,
then we never should have been able to convince ourselves
that our high faculties had been gradually developed. But
it can be shown that there is no fundamental difference of
this kind."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>I will not here ask how far this is theoretical assumption.
I shall endeavor to examine in another place the evidence
which is supposed to show that the mental powers of
man are in no respect fundamentally different, or different
in kind, from the powers in the other animals to which the
distinguished naturalist gives the name of "mental" powers.
At present I am still concerned with the parallelism
between the Platonic and the Darwinian theory; and I
again ask whether the latter is not the former reversed, in
respect to the process by which reason in the one case becomes
lost, and that by which in the other case it becomes
developed out of something to which it bears no resemblance?
Plato supposes the creation of pure reason, or
mental power, in the shape&mdash;to use the counterpart of a
physical term&mdash;of a non-physical, spiritual intelligence, or
mind. It remains always of this nature, but the successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
animals which it is required to inhabit on earth undergo
such degradations that the immortal reason loses in them
the power to control their actions; nothing is left to govern
in them but mere instinct, and this at last sinks into
its lowest manifestations. Darwin, on the other hand, supposes
the first creation to have been a very low animal of a
fish-like structure, with the lowest capacity for voluntary
action of any kind, but impelled to act in a certain way by
superimposed laws of self-preservation; that in the infinitude
of successive generations these laws have operated to
produce numberless gradations of structure, in the growth
of which fixed habits have become complex instincts; that
further gradations have developed these instincts into
something of mental power, as the successive higher animals
have become evolved out of the lower ones, until at
length the intellect of man has been "gradually developed"
by a purely physical process of the action of organized
matter.</p>

<p>This materialistic way of accounting for the origin of
the human mind necessarily excludes the idea of its separate
creation or its distinctive character. The theory is perfectly
consistent with itself, in supposing that the mind of
man does not differ in kind, or differ fundamentally, from
those exhibitions which in the lower animals lead us to attribute
to them some mental power. But whether the theory
is consistent with what we know of our own minds, as
compared with what we can observe in the other animals,
is the real question. In the first place, it is to be remembered
that we can read our own minds, by the power of consciousness
and reflection. In the next place, it is conceded
that we can know nothing of the minds of the other animals,
excepting by their outward actions. They can not
speak, to tell us of their emotions, their memories, their
fears, their hopes, their desires, what they think, or whether
they think at all. They do acts which wonderfully resem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>ble
the acts of man, in outward appearance, as if they were
acts which proceeded from the same power of reason but in
a less perfect degree; yet they can tell us nothing of their
mental processes, if they have such processes, and the utmost
that we can do is to argue from their acts that they
have mental faculties akin to those of men. It is in the
ordained nature of things that we know and can know, by
introspection, what our own minds are. We can know the
mind of no other animal excepting from his outward acts.
How far these will justify us in assuming that his mind is
of the same nature as ours, or that ours is an advanced development
of his, is the fundamental question.</p>

<p>Plato was evidently led, by that study of the human
mind which is open to all cultivated intellects through the
process of consciousness and reflection, to conceive of the
soul as a created intelligence of a spiritual nature. The
fanciful materials out of which he supposes it to have been
composed were the mere machinery employed to express
his conception of its spiritual nature and its indestructible
existence. He was led to employ such machinery by his
highly speculative and constructive tendencies, and because
it was the habit of Greek philosophy to account for everything.
Some machinery he was irresistibly impelled to employ,
in order to give due consistency to his theory. But
his machinery in no way obscures his conception of the nature
of the soul, and we may disregard it altogether and
still have left the conception of a spiritual and immortal
being, formed for separate existence from matter, but united
to matter for a temporary purpose of discipline and trial.</p>

<p>The modern naturalist, on the other hand, although assuming
the existence of the Omnipotent God, supposes the
human mind to have become what it is by the action of
organized matter beginning at the lowest point of animal
life, and going on through successive gradations of animal
structure, until habits are formed which become instincts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and instincts are gradually developed into mind. Take
away the machinery that is employed, and you have left no
conception of the immortal and indestructible nature of the
human soul. The material out of which it is constructed
is all of the earth earthy, and the twofold question arises:
first, whether this was the probable method employed by the
Omnipotent Creator; and, secondly, whether it will account
for such an existence as we have reason to believe the mind
of man to be.</p>

<p>There is another point in the parallel between the Platonic
and the Darwinian systems which is worthy of note.
We have seen that, according to Plato, when the Demiurgus
had completed the construction of the Kosmos and that of
the human soul, he retired and left to the gods the construction
of a mortal body for man and of bodies of the inferior
animals into which man would become degraded. According
to Darwin, the Omnipotent God constructs some very
low form of animal, and then, retiring from the work of
direct creation, he leaves the laws of natural and sexual
selection to operate in the production of higher animals
through the process that is called evolution. Perhaps it
may be unscientific to ask why the Omnipotent God should
cease to exercise, or refrain from exercising, his power of
special creation, after he has once exerted it. Perhaps
there is some view of the nature and purposes of that infinite
being which would render such an abstention from
his powers a probable occurrence. But it is difficult to
conceive what this view can be. If we take a comprehensive
survey of all the facts concerning the animal kingdom
that are within the reach of our observation; and if, then,
in cases where we know of no intermediate or transitional
states, we assume that they must have existed; if we array
the whole in support of a certain theory which undertakes to
account both for what we see and for what we do not see, we
very easily reach the conclusion that the Omnipotent God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
performed but one act of special creation, or at most performed
but a very few of such acts, and those of the rudest
and simplest types, and then left all the subsequent and
splendid exhibitions of animal structure to be worked out
by natural selection. This is the scientific method adopted
by the evolution school to account for the existence of all
the higher animals of which we have knowledge, man included.
It may be very startling, but we must acknowledge
it as the method of action of the Omnipotent God, because
it is said there is no logical impossibility in it.</p>

<p>There is a passage in Mr. Darwin's "Origin of Species"
which I must now quote, because it shows how strongly
the supposed action and abstention of the infinite Creator,
according to the Darwinian theory, resembles the action
and abstention of Plato's Demiurgus: "Although the belief
that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been
formed by natural selection, is enough to stagger any one;
yet in the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of
gradations in complexity, each good for its possessor; then,
under changing conditions of life, there is no logical impossibility
in the acquirement of any conceivable degree of
perfection through natural selection. In the cases in which
we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we
should be extremely cautious in concluding that none can
have existed, for the metamorphoses of many organs show
what wonderful changes in function are at least possible.
For instance, a swim-bladder has apparently been converted
into an air-breathing lung. The same organ having performed
simultaneously very different functions, and then
having been in part or in whole specialized for one function;
and two distinct organs having performed at the
same time the same function, the one having been perfected
while aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated
transitions."</p>

<p>Here, then, we have it propounded that after the creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of the rudest and simplest form of a visual organ, the infinite
God abstains from direct and special creation of such
a perfect and elaborate organ as the human eye, and leaves
it to be worked out by natural selection; there being no
logical impossibility, it is said, in this hypothesis. We are
cautioned not to conclude, because we can not find the intermediate
and transitional states of the visual organs, that they
never existed; we are told that they are at least possible,
and that analogies show they must have existed; and from
the possibility of their existence and from the assumption
that they happened, we are to believe that the Omnipotent
God, refraining from the exercise of his power to create
the human eye, with its wondrously perfect structure, left
it to be evolved by natural selection out of the rudest and
simplest visual organ which he directly fashioned.</p>

<p>All things are possible to an infinite Creator. He who
made the visual organ of the lowest aquatic creature that
ever floated could make the human eye as we know it, or
could make one that would do more than the eye of man
ever was capable of. He could by a direct exercise of his
power of creation form the eye of man, or he could leave
it to be evolved out of the only type of a visual organ on
which he saw fit to exercise his creative power. He could
create in the land-animals a true air-breathing lung as a
special production of his will, or could permit it to be
formed by transitional gradations out of the swim-bladder
of an aquatic creature. But why should he abstain from
the one method and employ the other? This question
brings us at once to the probabilities of the case; and, in
estimating those probabilities, we must take into the account
all that reason permits us to believe of the attributes
of the Almighty. We can not, it is true, penetrate into his
counsels without the aid of revelation. But if we confine
ourselves to the domain of science, or to the mere observation
of nature, we shall find reason for believing that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Omnipotent God had purposes in his infinite wisdom that
render the acts of special creation vastly more probable
than the theory of evolution. A study of the animal kingdom
and of all the phenomena of the universe leads us
rationally and inevitably to one of two conclusions: either
that there is no God, and that all things came by chance;
or to the belief that there is a God, and that he is a being
of infinite benevolence as well as infinite wisdom and
power. Now, why should such a being, proposing to himself
the existence on earth of such an animal as man, to be
inhabited for a time by a soul destined to be immortal,
abstain from the direct creation of both soul and body, and
leave the latter to be evolved out of the lowest form of
animal life, and the former to become a mere manifestation
or exhibition of phenomena, resulting from the improved
and more elaborate structures of successive types of animals?
Is there no conceivable reason why an infinitely
wise, benevolent, and omnipotent being should have chosen
to exercise the direct power of creation in forming the soul
of man for an immortal existence, and also to exercise his
direct power of creation in so fashioning the body as to fit
it with the utmost exactness to be serviceable and subservient
to the mind which is to inhabit it for a season? Why
depict the infinite God as a quiescent and retired spectator
of the operation of certain laws which he has imposed upon
organized matter, when there are discoverable so many
manifest reasons for the special creation of such a being as
man? It is hardly in accordance with any rational theory
of God's providence, after we have attained a conception
of such a being, to liken him intentionally or unintentionally
to the Demiurgus of the acute and ingenious
Greek philosopher. We must conclude that human society,
with all that it has done or is capable of doing for man on
earth, was in the contemplation of the Almighty; and if
we adopt this conclusion, we must account for the moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
sense, for moral obligation, and for the idea of law and duty.
We can not account for these things upon any probable
theory of their origin, if we reject the idea that they were
specially implanted in the structure of the human soul, and
suppose that both the intellectual faculties and the moral
sense were evolved out of the struggle of lower animals for
their existence, resulting in the formation of higher animals
and in the development of their social instincts into more
complex, refined, and consciously calculating instincts of
the same nature.</p>

<p>I have not drawn this parallel between the Platonic and
the Darwinian theories of the origin of different animals
for any purpose of suggesting that the one was in any sense
borrowed from the other. Plagiarism, in any form, is not,
so far as I know, to be detected in the writings of the evolution
school. But the speculations of Plato in regard to
the origin and nature of the human soul, fanciful as they
are, afford great assistance in grasping the conception of a
spiritual existence; and the parallel between his process of
degradation and Darwin's process of elevation shows to my
mind as great probability in the one theory as there is in
the other.</p>

<p class="intro">The Darwinian pedigree of man&mdash;The evolution of organisms out of other
organisms, according to the theory of Darwin.</p>


<p>It is doubtless an interesting speculation to go back in
imagination to a period to be counted by any number of
millions of years, or covered by an immeasurable lapse of
time, and to conceive of slowly-moving causes by which the
present or the past inhabitants of this globe became developed
out of some primordial type, through successive
generations, resulting in different species, which became
final products and distinct organisms. But what the imagination
can do in the formation of a theory when acting
upon a certain range of facts is, as a matter of belief, to be
tested by the inquiry whether the weight of evidence shows
that theory to be, in a supreme degree, a probable truth,
when compared with any other hypothesis. It is in this
way that I propose to examine and test the Darwinian pedigree
of man. The whole of Mr. Darwin's theory of the
descent of man as an animal consists in assigning to him a
certain pedigree, which traces his organism through a long
series of other animals back to the lowest and crudest form
of animal life; and it must be remembered that this mode
of accounting for the origin of man of necessity supposes
an unbroken connection of lives with lives, back through
the whole series of organisms which constitute the pedigree,
and that, according to the Darwinian theory, there
was no aboriginal creation of any of these organisms, save
the very first and lowest form with which the series com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>mences.
Not only must this connection of lives with lives
be shown, but the theory must be able to show how it has
come about that there are now distinct species of animals
which never reproduce any type but their own.</p>

<p>Two great agencies, according to the Darwinian theory,
have operated to develop the different species of animals
from some low primordial type, through a long series which
has culminated in man, who can not lay claim to be a special
creation, but must trace his pedigree to some ape-like creature,
and so on to the remote progenitor of all the <i lang="la">Vertebrata</i>.
It is now needful to grasp, with as much precision as such
a theory admits of, the nature and operation of these agencies,
and to note the strength or weakness of the proof
which they afford of the main hypothesis. First, we have
what is called "the struggle for existence," which may be
conceded as a fact, and to which more or less may be attributed.
The term is used by Mr. Darwin in a metaphorical
sense, to include all that any being has to encounter in
maintaining its individual existence, and in leaving progeny,
or perpetuating its kind. In the animal kingdom,
the struggle for individual existence is chiefly a struggle
for food among the different individuals which depend on
the same food, or against a dearth of one kind of food
which compels a resort to some other kind. The struggle
for a continuation of its species is dependent on the success
with which the individual animal maintains the contest for
its own existence. Now, it is argued that in this great and
complex battle for life it would occur that infinitely varied
diversities of structure would be useful to the animals in
helping them to carry on the battle under changing conditions.
These useful diversities, consisting of the development
of new organs and powers, would be preserved
and perpetuated in the offspring, through many successive
generations, while the variations that were injurious would
be rigidly destroyed. The animals in whom these favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>able
individual differences and variations of structure were
preserved would have the best chance of surviving and of
procreating their kind. So that, by this "survival of the
fittest," Nature is continually selecting those variations of
structure which are useful, and continually rejecting or
eliminating those which are injurious; the result being the
gradual evolution of successive higher types of animals out
of the lower ones, until we reach man, the highest animal
organism that exists on this earth. In the next place, we
have, as an auxiliary agency, in aid of natural selection, what
is called "the sexual selection," by which the best endowed
and most powerful males of a given species appropriate the
females, and thus the progeny become possessed of those
variations of structure and the superior qualities which have
given to the male parent the victory over his competitors.</p>

<p>The proofs that are relied upon to establish the operation
and effect of these agencies in producing the results
that are claimed for them, ought to show that, in one or
more instances, an animal of a superior organization which,
when left to the natural course of its reproduction by the
union of its two sexes, always produces its own distinct
type and no other, has, in fact, been itself evolved out of
some lower and different organism by the agencies of natural
and sexual selection operating among the individuals of
that lower type. One of the proofs, on which great stress
is laid by Mr. Darwin, may be disposed of without difficulty.
It is that which is said to take place in the breeding
of domestic animals, or of animals the breeding of which
man undertakes to improve for his own practical benefit,
or to please his fancy, or to try experiments. In all that
has been done in this kind of selection, in breeding from
the best specimens of any class of animals, there is not one
instance of the production of an animal varying from its
near or its remote known progenitors in anything but adventitious
peculiarities which will not warrant us in regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>ing
it as a new or different animal. No breeder of horses
has ever produced an animal that was not a horse. He
may have brought about great and important improvements
in the qualities of fleetness, or strength, or weight, or endurance,
by careful selection of the sire and the dam; but
the race-horse or the hunter, or the draught-horse or the war-horse,
is but a horse of different qualities and powers, with
the same skeleton, viscera, organs, muscles, which mark
this species of animal, and with no other variations of
structure than such as follow from the limited development
of different parts for different uses. No breeder of cows
ever produced a female animal that was not a cow, although
he may have greatly improved the quality and quantity of
the milk peculiar to this animal by careful selection of the
individuals which he permits or encourages to breed. No
breeder of sheep ever produced an animal that was not a
sheep, although the quality of the fleece or of the mutton
may have been greatly improved or varied. Among the
domestic fowls, no animal that was not a bird was ever bred
by any crossing of breeds, although great varieties of plumage,
structure of beak, formation of foot, development of
wing, habits of life, adaptation to changes of situation, and
many minor peculiarities, have been the consequences of
careful and intelligent breeding from different varieties of
the same fowl. In the case of the pigeon, of which Mr.
Darwin has given a great many curious facts from his own
experience as a breeder, the most remarkable variations are
perhaps to be observed as the results of intentional breeding
from different races of that bird; but with all these
variations nothing that was not a bird was ever produced.
In the case of the dog, whatever was his origin, or supposing
him to have been derived from the wolf, or to belong
to the same family as the wolf, it is, of course, impossible
to produce, by any crossing of different breeds of dogs, an
animal that would not belong to the class of the <i lang="la">Canidæ</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Indeed, it is conceded by Darwin, with all the array of
facts which he adduces in regard to the domesticated animals,
that by crossing we can only get forms in some degree
intermediate between the parents; and that although
a race may be modified by occasional crosses, if aided by
careful selection of the individuals which present the desired
character, yet to obtain a race intermediate between
two distinct races would be very difficult, if not impossible.
If this is so, how much more remote must be the possibility,
by any selection, or by any crossing to which Nature
will allow the different animals to submit, to produce an
animal of so distinct a type that it would amount to a different
species from its known progenitors!</p>

<p>From all that has been brought about in the efforts of
man to improve or to vary the breeds of domestic animals&mdash;a
kind of selection that is supposed to be analogous to what
takes place in Nature, although under different conditions&mdash;it
is apparent that there are limitations to the power of
selection in regard to the effects that are to be attributed to
it. A line must be drawn somewhere. It will not do in
scientific reasoning, or in any other reasoning, to ignore
the limitations to which all experience and observation
point with unerring certainty, so far as experience and observation
furnish us with facts. It is true that the lapse
of time during which there has been, with more or less
success, an intentional improvement in the breeds of domestic
animals carried on with recorded results has been
very short when compared with the enormous period that
has elapsed since the first creation of an animal organization,
whenever or whatever that creation was. But history
furnishes us with a pretty long stretch of time through
which civilized, half-civilized, and savage nations have had
to do with various animals in first taming them from a wild
state and then in domesticating so as to make them subservient
to human wants, and finally in improving their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
breeds. But there is no recorded or known instance in
which there has been produced under domestication an animal
which can be said to be of a different species from its
immediate known progenitors, or one that differed from its
remote known progenitors in any but minor and adventitious
peculiarities of structure. If in passing from what
has been done by human selection in the breeding of animals
to what has taken place in Nature in a much longer
space of time and on a far greater scale, we find that in
Nature, too, there are limitations to the power of that
agency which is called natural selection&mdash;that there is an
impassable barrier which Nature never crosses, an invincible
division between the different species of animals&mdash;we
must conclude that there is a line between what selection
can and what it can not do. We must conclude,
with all the scope and power that can be given to natural
selection, that Nature has not developed a higher and
differently organized animal out of a lower and inferior
type&mdash;has not made new species by the process called
evolution, because the infinite God has not commissioned
Nature to do that thing, but has reserved it unto himself
to make special creations. Do not all that we know
of the animal kingdom&mdash;all that naturalists have accumulated
of facts and all that they concede to be the absence
of facts&mdash;show that there is a clear and well-defined
limitation to the power of natural selection, as well as to
the power of that other agency which is called sexual selection?
Grant that this agency of natural selection began to
operate at a period, the commencement of which is as remote
as figures can describe; that the struggle for life began
as soon as there was an organized being existing in
numbers sufficiently large to be out of proportion to the
supply of food; that the sexual selection began at the same
time, and that both together have been operating ever since
among the different species of animals that have success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>ively
arisen and successively displaced each other throughout
the earth. The longer we imagine this period to have
been, the stronger is the argument against the theory of
evolution, because the more numerous will be the absences
of the gradations and transitions necessary to prove an unbroken
descent from the remote prototype which is assumed
to have been the first progenitor of the whole animal kingdom.
Upon the hypothesis that evolution is a true account
of the origin of the different animals, we ought practically
to find no missing links in the chain. The fact is that the
missing links are both extremely numerous and important;
and the longer the period assumed&mdash;the further we get from
the probability that these two agencies of natural and sexual
selection were capable of producing the results that are
claimed for them&mdash;the stronger is the proof that a barrier
has been set to their operation, and the more necessary is
it to recognize the line which separates what they can from
what they can not do.</p>

<p>Let us now see what is the state of the proof. It may
assist the reader to understand the Darwinian pedigree of
man if I present it in a tabulated form, such as we are accustomed
to use in exhibiting to the eye the pedigree of a single
animal. Stated in this manner, the Darwinian pedigree of
man may be traced as follows:</p>

<p>These ten classes or groups of animals are supposed to
be connected together by intermediate diversified forms,
which constitute the transitions from one of the classes or
groups to the other; and in reading the table downward it
must be remembered that we are reading in fact through
an ascending scale of beings, from the very lowest organized
creature to the highest. The whole, taken together, forms
a chain of evidence; and, according to the rational rules of
evidence, each distinct fact ought to be proved to have existed
at some time before our belief in the main hypothesis
can be challenged. I know of no reason why the probable
truth of a scientific hypothesis should be judged by any
other rules of determination than those which are applied
to any other subject of inquiry; and, while I am ready to
concede that in matters of physical science it is allowable
to employ analogy in constructing a theory, it nevertheless
remains, and must remain, true that where there are numerous
links in a supposed chain of proofs that are established
by nothing but an inference drawn from an analogous
fact, the collection of supposed proofs does not exclude
the probable truth of every other hypothesis but that
which is sought to be established, as it also does not establish
the theory in favor of which the supposed facts are
adduced. Upon these principles of evidence I propose now
to examine the Darwinian pedigree of man.</p>

<p>I. The group of marine animals described as resembling
the larvæ of existing Ascidians; that is to say, an aquatic
animal in the form of a grub, caterpillar, or worm, which is
the first condition of an insect at its issuing from the egg.
These assumed progenitors of the Vertebrata are reached,
according to Mr. Darwin, by "an obscure glance into a
remote antiquity," and they are described as "apparently"
existing, and as "resembling" the larvæ of existing Ascidians.
We are told that these animals were provided with
branchiæ, or gills, for respiration in water, but with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
most important organs of the body, such as the brain and
heart, imperfectly or not at all developed. This simple
and crude animal "we can see," it is said, "in the dim
obscurity of the past," and that it "must have been the
early progenitor of all the Vertebrata."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It is manifest
that this creature is a mere hypothesis, constructed, no
doubt, by the aid of analogy, but existing only in the eye
of scientific imagination. Why is it placed in the water?
For no reason, apparently, but that its supposed construction
is made to resemble that of some creatures which have
been found in the water, and because it was necessary to
make it the progenitor of the next group, the lowly-organized
fishes, in order to carry out the theory of the subsequent
derivations. It might have existed on the land, unless
at the period of its assumed existence the whole globe
was covered with water. If it had existed on the land, the
four subsequent forms, up to and including the Marsupials,
might have been varied to suit the exigencies of the pedigree
without tracing the descent of the Marsupials through
fishes and the Amphibians.</p>

<p>II. The group of lowly-organized fishes. These are
said to have been "probably" derived from the aquatic
worm (I), and they are described to have been as lowly
organized as the lancelet, which is a known fish of negative
characters, without brain, vertebral column, or heart, presenting
some affinities with the Ascidians, which are invertebrate,
hermaphrodite marine creatures, permanently
attached to a support, and consisting of a simple, tough,
leathery sack, with two small projecting orifices. The
larvæ of these creatures somewhat resemble tadpoles, and
have the power of swimming freely about. These larvæ of
the Ascidians are said to be, in their manner of development,
related to the Vertebrata in the relative position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the nervous system, and in possessing a structure closely
like the <i lang="la">chorda dorsalis</i> of vertebrate animals.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Here,
again, it is apparent that a group of lowly-organized fish-like
animals, of which there are no remains, have been constructed
by a process of scientific reasoning from a certain
class of marine creatures that are known. As a matter of
pure theory, there can be no serious objection to this kind
of construction, especially if it is supported by strong probabilities
furnished by known facts. But when a theory requires
this kind of reasoning in order to establish an important
link in a chain of proofs, it is perfectly legitimate
and necessary criticism that we are called upon to assume the
former existence of such a link; and, indeed, the theorists
themselves, with true candor and accuracy, tell us that they
are arguing upon probabilities from the known to the unknown,
or that a thing "must have existed" because analogies
warrant the assumption that it did exist. In a matter
so interesting, and in many senses important, as the evolution
theory of man's descent, it is certainly none too rigid to
insist on the application of the ordinary rules of belief.</p>

<p>III. The Ganoids and other fishes like the Lepidosiren.
These, we are told, "must have been developed" from the
preceding (II). The Ganoids, it is said, were fishes covered
with peculiar enameled bony scales. Most of them
are said to be extinct, but enough is known about them to
lay the foundation for their "probable" development from
the first fishes that are supposed to have been derived from
the aquatic worm (I). There is a reason for arguing the
existence of these first fishes as a true fish with the power
of locomotion, because the next ascending group of animals
is to be the Amphibians. In a fish, the swim-bladder is an
important organ; and it is an organ that plays an important
part in the Darwinian theory, furnishing, it is claimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
a very remarkable illustration that an organ constructed
originally for one purpose, flotation, may be converted into
one for a widely different purpose, namely, respiration. As
the Amphibians, which as a distinct group were to come
next after the fishes in the order of development, must be
furnished with a true air-breathing lung, their progenitors,
which inhabited the water only, must be provided with an
organ that would undergo, by transitional gradations, conversion
into a lung. But what is to be chiefly noted here
is that it is admitted that the prototype, which was furnished
with a swim-bladder, was "an ancient and unknown
prototype"; and it is a mere inference that the true lungs
of vertebrate animals are the swim-bladder of a fish so converted,
by ordinary generation, from the unknown prototype
because the swim-bladder is "homologous or 'ideally
similar' in position and structure with the lungs of the
higher vertebrate animals."<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> One might ask here without
presumption, why the Omnipotent God should not have
created in the vertebrate animals a lung for respiration, as
well as have created or permitted the formation of a swim-bladder
in a fish; and looking to the probabilities of the
case, it is altogether too strong for the learned naturalist to
assert that "there is no reason to doubt that the swim-bladder
has actually been converted into lungs or an organ
used exclusively for respiration"; especially as we are furnished
with nothing but speculation to show the intermediate
and transitionary modifications between the swim-bladder
and the lung. While we may not assume "that
the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man,"
in all respects, it is surely not presumptuous to suppose that
an Omnipotent and All-wise Being works by powers that
are competent to produce anything that in his infinite purposes
he may see fit specially to create.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>IV. The Amphibians. Here we come to what is now
a very numerous group, of which it is said that the first
specimens received, among other modifications, the transformation
of the swim-bladder of their fish progenitors into
an air-breathing lung. We are told that from the fishes of
the last preceding group (III) "a very small advance would
carry us on to the Amphibians."<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But whether the advance
from an animal living in the water and incapable of
existing out of that element, to an animal capable of living
on the land as well as in the water, was small or large, we
look in vain, at present, for the facts that constitute that
advance.</p>

<p>V. The Ancient Marsupials. These were an order of
mammals such as the existing kangaroos, opossums, etc.,
of which the young, born in a very incomplete state of development,
are carried by the mother, while sucking, in a
ventral pouch. They are supposed to have been the predecessors,
at an earlier geological period, of the placental
mammals, namely, the highest class of mammals, in which
the embryo, after it has attained a certain stage, is united
to the mother by a vascular connection called the <em>placenta</em>,
which secures nourishment that enables the young to be
born in a more complete state. There is a third and still
lower division of the great mammalian series, called the
Montremata, and said to be allied to the Marsupials. But
the early progenitors of the existing Marsupials, classed as
the Ancient Marsupials, are supposed to constitute the
connection between the Amphibians and the placental
mammals; that is to say, an animal which produced its
young by bringing forth an egg, from which the young
is hatched, became converted into an animal which produced
its young from a womb and nourished it after birth
from the milk supplied by its teats, the young being born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in a very incomplete state of development and carried by
the mother in a ventral pouch while it is sucking. The
steps of variation and development by which this extraordinary
change of structure, of modes of reproduction and
formation of organs, as well as habits of life, took place,
are certainly not yet discovered; and it is admitted, in respect
to forms "now so utterly unlike," that the production
of the higher forms by the process of evolution "implies the
former existence of links binding closely together all these
forms."<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In other words, we are called upon to supply by
general reasoning links of which we have as yet no proof.</p>

<p>VI. The Quadrumana and all the higher (or Placental)
Mammals. These are supposed to stand between the implacental
mammals (V) and the Lemuridæ (VII). The
latter were a group of four-handed animals, distinct from
the monkeys, and "resembling the insectivorous quadrupeds."
But the gradations which would show the transformation
from the implacental Marsupials to the placental
Quadrumana are wanting.</p>

<p>VII. The Lemuridæ. This branch of the placental
mammals is now actually represented by only a few varieties.
The early progenitors of those which still exist
are placed by Darwin in the series intermediate between
the Quadrumana and the Simiadæ; and according to Huxley
they were derived from the lowest, smallest, and least
intelligent of the placental mammalia.</p>

<p>VIII. The Simiadæ. This is the general term given
by naturalists to the whole group of monkeys. From the
Lemuridæ to the Simiadæ we are told by Darwin that "the
interval is not very wide." Be it wider or narrower, it
would be satisfactory to know whether the gradations by
which the former became the latter are established by anything
more than general speculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>IX. The Catarrhine, or Old-World Monkeys. These
are the great stem or branch of the Simiadæ which became
the progenitors of man. His immediate progenitors were
"probably" a group of monkeys called by naturalists the
Anthropomorphous Apes, being a group without tails or
callosities, and in other respects resembling man. While
this origin of man is gravely put forward and maintained
with much ingenuity, we are told that "we must not fall
into the error of supposing that the early progenitor of the
whole Simian stock, including man, was identical with, or
even closely resembled, any existing ape or monkey."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> So
that somewhere between the early progenitor of the whole
Simian stock and all that we know of the monkey tribe,
there were transitions and gradations and modifications
produced by natural and sexual selection which we must
supply as well as we can.</p>

<p>X. Man. We have now arrived at "the wonder and
glory of the universe," and have traced his pedigree from a
low form of animal, in the shape of an aquatic worm,
through successive higher forms, each developed out of its
predecessor by the operation of fixed laws, and without the
intervention of any special act of creation anywhere in the
series, whatever may have been the power and purpose by
and for which existence was given to the first organized
and living creature, the aquatic worm. Speaking of man
as belonging, from a genealogical point of view, to the Catarrhine,
or Old-World stock of monkeys, Mr. Darwin observes
that "we must conclude, however much the conclusion
may revolt our pride, that our early progenitors
would have been properly thus designated."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>I have already said that our pride may be wholly laid
out of consideration. The question of the probable truth
of this hypothesis of man's descent should not be affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
by anything but correct reasoning and the application of
proper principles of belief. Treating it with absolute indifference
in regard to the dignity of our race, I shall request
my readers to examine the argument by which it is
supported, without the smallest influence of prejudice. I
am aware that it is asking a good deal to desire the reader
to divest himself of all that nature and education and history
and poetry and religion have contributed to produce
in our feelings respecting our rank in the scale of being.
When I come to treat of that which, for want of a more
suitable term, must be called the substance of the human
mind, and to suggest how it bears upon this question of the
origin of man, I shall, as I trust, give the true, and no
more than the true, scope to those considerations which
lead to the comparative dignity of the race. But this dignity,
as I have before observed, should follow and should
not precede or accompany the discussion of the scientific
problem.</p>

<p>What has chiefly struck me in studying the theory of
evolution as an account of the origin of man is the extent
to which the theory itself has influenced the array of proofs,
the inconsequential character of the reasoning, and the
amount of assumption which marks the whole argument.
This is not said with any purpose of giving offense. What
is meant by it will be fully explained and justified, and one
of the chief means for its justification will be found in what
I have here more than once adverted to&mdash;Mr. Darwin's
own candor and accuracy in pointing out the particulars in
which important proofs are wanting. Another thing by
which I have been much impressed has been the repetition
of what is "probable," without a sufficient weighing of the
opposite probability; and sometimes this reliance on the
"probable" has been carried to the verge, and even beyond
the verge, of all probability. Doubtless the whole question
of special creations on the one hand and of gradual evo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>lution
on the other is a question of probability. But I
now refer to a habit among naturalists of asserting the
probability of a fact or an occurrence, and then, without
proof, placing that fact or occurrence in a chain of evidence
from which the truth of their main hypothesis is to be inferred.
It is creditable to them as witnesses, that they tell
us that the particular fact or occurrence is only probably
true, and that we are to look for proof of it hereafter. But
the whole theory thus becomes an expectant one. We are
to give up our belief that God made man in his own image&mdash;that
he fashioned our minds and bodies after an image
which he had conceived in his infinite wisdom&mdash;because we
are to expect at some future time to discover the proof that
he did something very different; that he formed some very
lowly-organized creature, and then sat as a retired spectator
of the struggle for existence, through which another and
then another higher form of being would be evolved, until
the mind and the body of man would both have grown out
of the successive developments of organic structure. We
can not see this now; we can not prove it; but we may
expect to be able to see it and to prove it hereafter.</p>

<p>The present state of the argument does not furnish
very strong grounds for the expectation of what the
future is to show. As far as I can discover, the main
ground on which the principle of evolution is accepted by
those who believe in it, is general reasoning. It is admitted
that there are breaks in the organic chain between
man and his nearest supposed allies which can not be bridged
over by any extinct or living species. The answer that is
made to this objection seems to me a very singular specimen
of reasoning. It is said that the objection will not
appear of much weight to those who believe in the principle
of evolution from general reasons. But how is it with
those who are inquiring, and who, failing to feel the force
of the "general reasons," seek to know what the facts are?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
When we are told that the breaks in the organic chain
"depend merely on the number of related forms which
have become extinct," is it asking too much to inquire how
it is known that there were such forms and that they have
become extinct? Geology, it is fully conceded on its highest
authorities, affords us very little aid in arriving at these
extinct forms which would connect man with his ape-like
progenitors; for, according to Lyell, the discovery of fossil
remains of all the vertebrate classes has been a very slow
and fortuitous process, and this process has as yet reached
no remains connecting man with some extinct ape-like
creature.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The regions where such remains would be most
likely to be found have not yet been searched by geologists.
This shows the expectant character of the theory,
and how much remains for the future in supplying the
facts which are to take the place of "general reasons."</p>

<p>But perhaps the most remarkable part of the argument
remains to be stated. The breaks in the organic chain of
man's supposed descent are admitted to be of frequent occurrence
in all parts of the series, "some being wide, sharp,
and defined, others less so in various degrees."<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But these
breaks depend merely, it is said, upon the number of related
forms that have become extinct, there being as yet no proof,
even by fossil remains, that they once existed. Now, the
prediction is that at some future time such breaks will be
found still more numerous and wider, by a process of extinction
that will be observed and recorded; and hence we
are not to be disturbed, in looking back into the past, by
finding breaks that can not be filled by anything but general
reasoning. The passage in which this singular kind
of reasoning is expressed by Mr. Darwin deserves to be
quoted:</p>

<p>"At some future period, not very distant as measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly
exterminate and replace the savage races throughout
the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes,
as Prof. Schaafhausen has remarked, will no doubt be
exterminated. The break between man and his nearest
allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man
in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the
Caucasian, and some ape as low as the baboon, instead of
as now between the negro or Australian and the gorilla."<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>I do not quite comprehend how the "more civilized
state of man" in the more or less remote future is to lead
to this wider break. One can understand how the whole of
mankind may become more civilized, and how the savage
races will disappear by extermination or otherwise. It may
be, and probably will be, that the anthropomorphous apes
will be exterminated at the same time. But the question
here is not in regard to a more perfect and widely diffused
civilization&mdash;a higher and universal elevation of the intellectual
and moral condition of mankind, a more improved
physical and moral well-being&mdash;but it is in regard to a
change in the physical and organic structure of the human
animal, so marked and pronounced as to produce a wider
break between man and his nearest supposed allies than that
which now exists between the negro or the Australian and
the gorilla. The anthropomorphous ape existing now will
have disappeared; but it will be a well-known and recorded
animal of the past. But what reason is there to expect that
natural and sexual selection, or the advance of civilization,
or the extermination of the savage races of mankind, or all
such causes combined, are going to change essentially the
structure of the human body to something superior to or
fundamentally different from the Caucasian individual?
We have had a tolerably long recorded history of the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
body as it has existed in all states of civilization or barbarism.
And although in the progress from barbarism to civilization&mdash;if
utter barbarism preceded civilization&mdash;the development
of its parts has been varied, and the brain especially
has undergone a large increase in volume and in the activity
of its functions, we do not find that the plan on which the
human animal was constructed, however we may suppose
him to have originated, has undergone any material change.</p>

<p>The most splendid specimen of the Caucasian race that
the civilized world can show to-day has no more organs,
bones, muscles, arteries, veins, or nerves than those which
are found in the lowest savage. He makes a different use
of them, and that use has changed their development, and
to some extent has modified stature, physical, intellectual,
and moral, and many other attributes; as climate and
habits of life have modified complexion, the diseases to
which the human frame is liable, and many other peculiarities.
But if we take historic man, we find that in all the
physical features of his animal construction that constitute
him a species, he has been essentially the same animal in all
states of civilization or barbarism; and unless we boldly
assume that the prehistoric man was an animal born with a
coat of hair all over his body, and that clothing was resorted
to as the hair in successive generations disappeared,
we can have no very strong reason for believing that the
human body has been at any time an essentially different
structure from what it is now. Even in regard to longevity
or power of continued life, if we set aside the exceptional
cases of what is related of the patriarchs in the biblical
records, we do not find that the average duration of human
life has been much greater or much less than the
threescore and ten or the fourscore years that are said to
have been the divinely appointed term. As to what may
have been the average duration of life among prehistoric
men, we are altogether in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>I must now revert to one of the most prominent of the
admitted breaks in the Darwinian pedigree, namely, that
which occurs at the supposed transition from the amphibians
to the mammalia. There is a term which is used in
mechanics to mark the characteristic and fundamental distinction
between one complex machine and another. We
speak of the "principle" on which a mechanical structure
operates, meaning the essential construction and mode of
operation which distinguish it from other machines of the
same general class. Although we are not to forget that
an animal organization, to which is given that mysterious
essence that is called life, may come into being by very
different processes from those which are employed by man
in dealing with dead matter and the forces which reside in
it, yet there is no danger of being misled into false analogies,
if we borrow from mechanics a convenient term, and
speak of the "principle" on which an animal is constructed
and on which its animal organization operates. We find,
then, that in the animal kingdom there is a perfectly clear
and pronounced division between the modes in which the
reproductive system is constructed and by which it operates
in the continuation of the species. The principle of
construction and operation of the reproductive system,
by which an individual animal is produced from an egg
brought forth by the female parent, and is thereafter nourished
without anything derived from the parental body, is
as widely different from that by which the young animal
is born from a womb and nourished for a time from the
milk of the mother, as any two constructions, animate or
inanimate, that can be conceived of. Whatever may be the
analogy or resemblance between the embryo that is in the
egg of one animal and the embryo that remains in the womb
of another animal, at the point at which the egg is expelled
from the parental system the analogy or resemblance ceases.
In certain animals a body that is called an egg is formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
in the female parent, containing an embryo, or fœtus, of
the same species, or the substance from which a like animal
is produced. This substance is inclosed in an air-tight vessel
or shell; when this has been expelled from the parent
the growth of the embryo goes on to the stage of development
at which the young animal is to emerge from the inclosure,
and, whatever may have been the process or means
of nourishment surrounding the embryo within the shell
and brought in that inclosure from the body of the parent,
the young animal never derives, at any subsequent stage of
its existence, either before or after it has left the shell, anything
more from the parental system. It may be "hatched"
by parental incubation or by heat from another source, but
for nourishment, after it leaves the shell, the young animal
is dependent on substances that are not supplied from the
parental body, although they may be gathered or put within
its reach by the parental care.</p>

<p>The transition from this system of reproduction to that
by which the fœtus is formed into a greater or less degree
of development within the body of the parent, and then
brought forth to be nourished into further development by
the parental milk, is enormous. The principle of the organic
construction and mode of perpetuating the species,
in the two cases, is absolutely unlike after we pass the point
at which the ovule is formed by the union of the male and
the female vesicles that are supposed to constitute its substance.
When we pass from the implacental to the placental
mammals we arrive at the crowning distinction between
the two great systems of reproduction which separates
them by a line that seems to forbid the idea that the one
has grown out of the other by such causes as natural selection,
and without a special and intentional creation of a
new and different mode of operation. On the one hand,
we have a system of reproduction by which the ovule is
brought forth from the body of the parent in an inclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
vessel, and thereafter derives nothing from the parental
body. In the other, we have the ovule developed into the
fœtus within the body of the parent, and the young animal
is then brought forth in a more or less complete state of
development, to be nourished by the parental secretion
called milk. The intervention of the placental connection
between the fœtus and the mother, whereby nourishment
is kept up so that the young animal may be born in a more
complete state of development, is a contrivance of marvelous
skill, which natural selection, or anything that can be
supposed to take place in the struggle for existence, or the
result of the sexual battle, seems to be entirely inadequate
to account for. If two such very diverse systems could be
supposed to have been the product of human contrivance,
we should not hesitate to say that the principle of the one
was entirely different from that of the other, and that the
change evinced the highest constructive skill and a special
design.</p>

<p>The Darwinian hypothesis is that this great transition
from the one system of reproduction to the other took place
between the amphibians and the ancient marsupials, by
the operation of the influences of natural and sexual selection.
That is to say, the system of reproduction through
an egg, which is the characteristic of the amphibians,
became changed by gradations and modifications into the
system of the lowest mammals, the distinction between
the former and the latter being an obvious and palpable
one. Then we are to suppose a further change from
the marsupials, or the implacental mammals, to that wonderful
contrivance, the <em>placenta</em>, by which the mother
nourishes the fœtus into a more complete state of development
before the young animal is born. This enormous
change of system is supposed to have been brought about
by a struggle among the individuals of one species for food,
aided by a struggle between the males of that species for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the possession of the females, by the growth and development
of organs useful to the animal in the two battles, and
by the transmission of these enhanced powers and improved
weapons to offspring, and possibly by the crossing of different
varieties of the new animals thus produced. But what
potency there could be in such causes to bring about this
great change it is extremely difficult to imagine, and we
must draw largely on our imaginations to reach it. It
would seem that if there is any one part of animal economy
that is beyond the influence of such causes as the "survival
of the fittest," it is the reproductive system, by which the
great divisions of the animal kingdom continue their respective
forms. Give all the play that you can to the operation
of the successful battle for individual life, and to the
victory of the best-appointed males over their competitors
for the possession of the females, and to the transmission
of acquired peculiarities to offspring&mdash;when you come to
such a change as that between the two systems of reproduction
and perpetuation, you have to account for something
which needs far more proof of the transitional gradations
of structure and habits of life than can now be found
between the highest of the amphibians and the lowest of
the mammalia. I know not how there could be higher or
stronger evidence of design, of a specially planned and intentionally
elaborated construction, than is afforded by this
great interval between the one reproductive system and the
other. But it is time now to pass to those points of resemblance
between man and the other mammals which are
asserted as the decisive proofs of his and their descent from
some pre-existing form, their common progenitor. These
points of resemblance may be considered in the following
order:</p>

<p>1. <em>The Bodily Structure of Man.</em>&mdash;He is notoriously
constructed on the same general type or model as other
mammals. "All the bones in his skeleton can be com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>pared
with corresponding bones in a monkey, bat, or seal.
So it is with his muscles, nerves, blood-vessels, and internal
viscera. The brain, the most important of all the organs,
follows the same law."<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>2. <em>The Liability of Man to certain Diseases to which
the Lower Animals are liable.</em>&mdash;These diseases, such as hydrophobia,
variola, the glanders, syphilis, cholera, etc., man
both communicates to and receives from some of the lower
animals. "This fact proves the close similarity of their
tissues and blood, both in minute structure and composition,
far more plainly than does their comparison under
the best microscope or by the aid of the best chemical analysis."
Monkeys are liable to many of the same non-contagious
diseases as we are, such as catarrh and consumption.
They suffer from apoplexy, inflammation of the bowels, and
cataract in the eye. Their young die from fever when shedding
their milk-teeth. Medicines produce the same effect
on them as on us, and they have a strong taste for tea, coffee,
spirituous liquors, and even tobacco. Man is infested
with both internal and external parasites of the same genera
or families as those infesting other mammals; in the case of
scabies, he is infested with the same species of parasites.
He is subject to the same law of lunar periods, in the
process of gestation, and in the maturation and duration
of certain diseases. His wounds are repaired by the same
process of healing, and, after the amputation of his limbs,
the stumps occasionally possess some power of regeneration,
as in the lowest animals.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>3. <em>The Reproductive Process.</em>&mdash;This is strikingly the
same, it is said, in all mammals, from the first act of courtship
by the male to the birth and nurturing of the young.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
The closeness of the parallel here, however, is obviously
between man and the other placental mammalia, if we re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>gard
the whole process of reproduction of the different
species.</p>

<p>4. <em>Embryonic Development.</em>&mdash;From the human ovule,
which is said to differ in no respect from the ovule of other
animals, into and through the early embryonic period, we
are told that the embryo of man can hardly be distinguished
from that of other members of the vertebrate kingdom.
It is not necessary to repeat the details of the resemblance,
which are undoubtedly striking, because they show
a remarkable similarity between the embryo of man and
that of the dog and the ape, in the earlier stage of the
development, and that it is not until quite in the later
stages of development that the three depart from each
other, the difference between the young human being and
the ape being not so great as that between the ape and the
dog. We may, of course, accept Prof. Huxley's testimony
that "the mode of origin [conception?] and the early
stages of the development of man are identical with those
of the animals immediately below him in the scale; without
a doubt, in these respects, he is far nearer to the apes
than the apes are to the dog."<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>5. <em>Rudiments.</em>&mdash;This is a somewhat obscure branch of
the proofs, which requires a more detailed examination in
order to appreciate its bearing on the general theory of evolution.
A distinction is made between rudimentary and
nascent organs. The former are absolutely useless to their
possessor&mdash;such as the mammæ of male quadrupeds, or the
incisor teeth of ruminants, which never cut through the
gums&mdash;or else they are of such slight service to their present
possessors that they can not be supposed to have been
developed under the conditions which now exist. These
useless, or very slightly useful, organs in the human frame,
are supposed to have been organs which had an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
utility in the lower animals from which man is descended,
but, by disuse at that period of life when the organ is
chiefly used, and by inheritance at a corresponding period
of life, they became of less and less utility in the successive
animals that were evolved out of the preceding forms,
until they sank into the condition of useless appendages,
although perpetuated by force of the derivation of one
species of animal from another, caused by the operation of
the laws of natural and sexual selection. Nascent organs,
on the other hand, are those which, though not fully developed
to their entire capability, are of high service to
their possessor, and may be carried to a higher degree of
utility. One of the characteristics, as it is said, of rudimentary
organs, is that they often become wholly suppressed
in individuals, and then reappear occasionally in
other individuals, through what is called reversion, or a
return to ancestral peculiarities.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> We are told that "not
one of the higher animals can be named which does not
bear some part in a rudimentary condition; and man forms
no exception to the rule."<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Among the rudiments that are peculiar to man, and
which are supposed to be proofs of his cognate relations to
the lower animals, we are referred to certain muscles in a
reduced condition, which in the other animals are used to
move, twitch, or contract the skin, and remnants of which,
in an efficient state, are found in various parts of our
bodies; for instance, the muscles which raise the eyebrows,
those which contract the scalp, those which, in some individuals,
move the external ear, and similar muscular powers
in different parts of the body. These are adduced as illustrations
of the persistent transmission of an absolutely useless,
or almost useless, faculty, "probably" derived from
our remote semi-human progenitors. There is also another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
rudiment in man, found in the covering of the eye, and
called by anatomists the "semi-lunar fold," which in birds
is of great functional importance, as it can be rapidly drawn
across the whole eyeball. In those animals in which, with its
accessory muscles and other structures, it is well developed,
as in some reptiles and amphibians, and in sharks, it is a
third eyelid. In the two lower divisions of the mammalian
series, the monotremata and the marsupials, and in some
few of the higher mammals, as in the walrus, it is said to be
fairly well developed. But in man, in the quadrumana,
and most other mammals, it has become a mere rudiment.</p>

<p>The sense of smell in man is also classed by Darwin and
other naturalists among the rudiments. It is argued that
it was not originally acquired by man as he now exists, but
that he has inherited this power, in an enfeebled and so
far rudimentary condition, from some early progenitor, to
whom it was highly serviceable, and by whom it was continually
used.</p>

<p>Then we have the rudiment of hair, which, so far as it
now exists on different parts of our body, is regarded as a
mere remnant of the uniform hairy coat of the lower animals.
Man, as he is now born, "differs conspicuously
from all the other primates in being almost naked." But
this nearly nude condition was not, it is said, the condition
of his progenitors, and it is not the condition of his co-descendants
from the same progenitors. At some time the
progenitors of man and his co-descendants became covered
all over with a coat of hair. What remains upon our bodies
of this peculiar growth, that is called hair, is what was left
after the agency of natural selection had worked off what
was useless to the successive animals, and sexual selection
had operated to transmit to offspring the absence of hair
that had accrued in the nearer progenitors and the immediate
parents. The illustrations which render this view
"probable" do not need to be repeated, nor is it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
to follow out the speculations concerning the mode in
which our progenitors, near or remote, became varied in
respect to the quantity, position, or direction of the hairs
on various parts of their bodies.</p>

<p>There are several other alleged homologues or rudiments
which are supposed to connect man with the lower animals,
but which, whatever may be the resemblances, it is not
necessary to discuss in detail, because there is one consideration
at least which applies to the whole of this class of
proofs, and to that I now pass. The three great classes of
facts on which the whole argument rests, viewing man as
an animal and omitting all reference to his intellect, are
the resemblances of his bodily structure to that of the other
mammals, the similarity between his embryonic development
and theirs, and the rudiments. I reserve for separate
discussion the counter-proof which may be derived from
the nature of the human mind, and the special adaptation
of the human structure to become the temporary residence
and instrument of a spiritual and immortal being.</p>

<p>"It is," says Mr. Darwin, "no scientific explanation to
assert that they have all [man and the other animals of the
mammalian class] been formed on the same ideal plan."<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
The similarity of pattern is pronounced "utterly inexplicable"
upon any other hypothesis than that all these animals
are descended from a common progenitor, and that they
have become what they are by subsequent adaptation to
diversified conditions. I may incur some risk in undertaking
to suggest what is a "scientific" explanation. Certainly
I do not propose to "assert" anything. But I will
endeavor to keep within the bounds of what I suppose to
be science. I take that to be a scientific explanation
which, embracing the important facts of natural history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
as the groundwork of the reasoning, undertakes to show
the rationality of one hypothesis that differs from another,
when the question is, Which has the greater amount of
probability in its favor?</p>

<p>All correct reasoning on this subject of man's descent
as an animal begins, I presume, with the postulate of an
Infinite Creator, having under his power all the elements
and forms of matter, organized and unorganized, animate
and inanimate. There is no fundamental difference of
opinion on this point, as I understand, between some of
the evolutionists and their opponents.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Omnipotence,
boundless choice of means and ends, illimitable wisdom, a
benevolence that can not fail and can not err, are the conceded
attributes of the being who is supposed to preside
over the universe; and, however difficult it may be for us
to express a conception of infinite power and infinite wisdom,
as it is to describe infinite space and duration, we
know what we mean to assume when we speak or think of
faculties that are without limit, and of moral qualities that
are subject to no imperfection. It is true that we have no
means of forming an idea of superhuman and infinite
power but by a comparison of our own limited faculties
with those which we assume to belong to an eternal and
infinite God. But the nature of our own limited powers
teaches us that there may be powers that are as far above
ours as the heavens are above the earth, as the endless
realms of space stretch beyond and forever beyond any
measurable distance, as eternity stretches beyond and forever
beyond all measurable time. At all events, the postulate
of an infinite God is the one common starting-point for
the scientists of the evolution school and those who accept
their doctrine, and for those who dissent from it. If I did
not assume this, I could not go one step further, for with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>out
it there could not be a basis for any reasoning on the
subject that would lead anywhere but to the conclusion that
all that exists came by blind chance. This conclusion is
rejected alike by the scientists, whose views I am now examining,
and by those who differ from them.</p>

<p>In the economy of Nature, which is but another term
for the economy of the Omnipotent Creator, there is no
waste of power, as there is no abstention from the exercise
of power, where its exertions are needed to accomplish an
end. By this I mean that when a general plan of construction
is found carried out through a variety of organizations,
the rational inference is that so much power has been exerted
as was needful to accomplish in each organization the
objects that are common to all of them, and that no more
power has been used in that direction. But where a special
adaptation in some one variety of the same class of constructions
is needful to accomplish an object peculiar to a
new variety, the necessary amount of power never fails to
be exerted. A study of the animal kingdom reveals this
great truth, as palpably as a study of the products of
human skill reveals the fact that man, from the imperfection
of his faculties, is constantly exerting more or less
power than was needful in his efforts to produce a new
variety in his mechanical constructions. Experience and
accumulated knowledge enable us to carry a general plan
of construction through a considerable group of mechanical
forms; but it is when we endeavor to vary the principle of
construction so as to produce a new and special mode of
operation, that we either waste power in repeating the
general plan or fail to exercise the amount of power necessary
to adapt the general plan to the introduction of the
special object at which we are aiming. Our success in
making such adaptations is often wonderful, but our failures
evince that our imperfect faculties do not always enable
us to accomplish the necessary adaptations of the gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>eral
plan of construction to the special objects which we
wish to attain. To the Infinite Creator, all such difficulties
are unknown. He neither wastes power by new plans
that are unnecessary, nor makes "vain repetitions," nor
fails to exert the requisite amount of power and wisdom in
the introduction of new and special contrivances which he
ingrafts upon or superadds to the general plan, and which
he has devised for the accomplishment of a new object.
With a boundless choice of means and ends, with a skill
that can not err, with a prescience that sees the end from
the first conception of the design, he can repeat the general
plan throughout any variety of constructions without any
waste of power, and can introduce the new adaptations or
contrivances which are to constitute a new construction,
by the exercise of all the power that is required to accomplish
a special object. Whether we are to suppose that he
does this by the establishment of certain laws which he
leaves to operate within prescribed limits, or does it by
special creations proceeding from direct and specific exertions
of his will, the question of his power to employ the
one method or the other remains always the same. The
question of which was his probable method depends upon the
force of evidence; and upon this question we must allow
great weight to the fact which all Nature discloses, namely,
that the Creator does not waste power by making new plans
of construction where an existing plan may be usefully repeated,
and that he does not fail to exercise the necessary
power when he wishes to add to the general plan of construction
a new and special organism for a particular purpose.</p>

<p>Is there anything presumptuous in thus speaking of the
determination and purposes of the Omnipotent Creator?
We have his existence and infinite attributes conceded as
the basis of all sound reasoning on his works. Why then
should we not infer his purposes and his acts from his
works? Why should we not attribute to him a special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
design, when we can not examine his works without inferring
such special design, unless we conclude that the most
amazing and peculiar constructions grew up under the
operation of causes of which we have no sufficient proof,
and in the supposed result of which there are admitted
chasms that can not be bridged over?</p>

<p>To return now to the resemblance between the bodily
structure of man and that of his supposed progenitors.
The assertion is that a repetition of the same general plan
of construction throughout a class of animals can only be
explained upon the hypothesis of their descent from a common
progenitor. They are, it is claimed, co-descendants
from some one ancient animal; and however they may
differ from each other, in all these co-descendants from
that animal we find the same general plan of construction,
the same ideal model repeated. Among the whole class of
the higher mammals, we have skeletons, muscles, nerves,
blood-vessels, internal viscera, organs, that closely correspond.
What does this prove but that there was no waste
of power, because there was no necessity in making man,
for the formation of a general plan of construction different
in these particulars from that which was employed in
making the monkey, the bat, or the seal? The similarity
of pattern between the hand of a man or a monkey, the
foot of a horse, the flipper of a seal, or the wing of a bat,
is pronounced "utterly inexplicable" upon any hypothesis
but that of descent from a common progenitor. But why
is not this sameness of ideal plan just as consistent with
the hypothesis that the same ideal plan would answer for
the human hand or the hand of an ape, the foot of the
horse, the flipper of the seal, or the wing of the bat?<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
is when you pass from such resemblances and come to the
special contrivances which separate one animal from another
by a broad line of demarkation, that you are to look
for the adaptation of special contrivances to repetitions of
the same ideal model through the varying species. Take,
for example, the introduction among the mammals of the
placental system of reproduction, parturition, and subsequent
nourishment of the young, combined with the nourishment
of the fœtus while it continues in the body of the
mother. This system would require no material variation
from the general plan of construction that is common to
the different mammals of this class in respect to the parts
where the resemblances are kept up throughout the series,
such as those of the skeleton, muscles, nerves, viscera, and
other organs that are found in all of them. But for the
introduction of this peculiar system of reproduction and
continuation of the species, there was needful a special and
most extraordinary contrivance. If such a contrivance or
anything like it had been produced by human skill, and
been introduced into a mechanical structure, we should
not hesitate to say that there had been an invention of a
most special character. When you follow this system
through the different animals in which it is found operating,
and find that the period of gestation and of suckling is
varied for each of them, that for each there is the necessary
modification of trunk, situation of the organs, assimilation
of food and formation of milk, and many other peculiarities,
what are you to conclude but that there has been an
adaptation of a new system to a general plan of construction,
and that while the latter remains substantially the same, it
has had ingrafted upon or incorporated with it a most singular
contrivance, so original, comprehensive, and flexible,
that its characteristic principle admits of the most exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
working in animals that are as far asunder as man and
the horse, or as the horse and the seal, or as the seal and
the bat?</p>

<p>The resemblances between the embryonic development
of man and the other mammals present another instance of
the constantly occurring fact that there has been no waste
of power on the one hand, and on the other no failure to
exert the amount of power requisite to produce a new
variation of the general principle. There is no more logical
force in the hypothesis of a common progenitor, in
order to account for these resemblances, than there is in
the hypothesis that the general system of embryonic development
was first devised, and that it was then varied in
each distinct animal according to the requirements of its
special construction. Upon the latter supposition, there
would be resemblances to a certain stage, and then there
would follow the departures which we have no difficulty in
tracing. Upon the former supposition we should expect
to find, what we actually do find, that it is very difficult, if
not impossible, to assign any reason for the departures, or
to suggest how it has happened that one animal is so absolutely
distinct from another. Thus, to begin with the
embryo itself, and to trace it through its stages of development,
we find that in man it can hardly be distinguished
from that of other members of the vertebrate kingdom.
This we should expect to be the case after we have learned
the great fact that Nature operates upon a uniform principle
up to the point where variations and departures are to
supervene. The system of embryonic development being
devised to operate in parallel lines through all the placental
mammals until the lines should begin to depart from each
other so as to result in animals of different species, would
necessarily show strong resemblances of structure until the
departures supervened. There would be, in other words, a
strong illustration of the truth that in the Divine economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
there is no waste of power. But when the stage is reached
at which the departures may be noted, and the lines diverge
into the production of organized beings differing widely
from each other, we reach an equally striking illustration
of the corresponding truth that the amount of power necessary
to produce very different results never fails to be put
forth. There is no good reason why this latter exertion of
power should not be attributed to special design just as
logically and rationally as we must attribute to intentional
purpose and infinite skill the general system of embryonic
development which has been made for the whole class of
the placental mammals. While, therefore, we may accept
as a fact Prof. Huxley's statement on this branch of comparative
anatomy, we are under no necessity to accept
his conclusion. To the question whether man originates
in a different way from a dog, bird, frog, or fish, this
anatomist answers, as already quoted: "The reply is not
doubtful for a moment; without question, the mode of
origin and the early stages of the development of man
are identical with those of the animals immediately below
him in the scale; without a doubt, in these respects he is
far nearer to apes than apes are to the dog." This refers,
of course, to the parallelism that obtains in the early stages
of the embryonic development. It necessarily implies, at
later stages, diverging lines, which depart more or less
from each other, and thus we have between the ape and
the man a nearer approach than we have between the ape
and the dog. But how does this displace, or tend to displace,
the hypothesis of a general system of embryonic development
for all animals of a certain class, and an intentional
and special variation of that system so as to produce
different species of animals? The identity between the
mode of origin and the early stages of the development of
man and those of the animals immediately below him in
the scale, is strong proof of the applicability of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
general principle of development throughout all the animals
of a certain class. The cessation of the parallelism at
the diverging lines is equally strong proof of a design to
create an animal differing as man does from the ape, or as
the ape does from the dog. The argument that these
three species are co-descendants from a common progenitor,
viewing man simply as an animal, is at least no stronger
than the argument which leads to the conclusion of special
creations.</p>

<p>The same thing may be said of the liability of man to
certain contagious or non-contagious diseases in common
with some of the lower animals. That there is a similarity
in the chemical composition of the blood of an entire class
of animals, in the structure of their tissues and blood-vessels,
so that they are subject to the same causes of inflammation
or to the same parasites, is proof of a uniform
plan of the fluids and the vascular system, or, in other
words, it evinces that here, too, there has been in these
respects no waste of power in forming the different animals
of the same class. But trace back the supposed pedigree
of the animals sharing this chemical composition of the
blood, character of tissues, and vascular system, until you
have passed through the amphibians and reached their supposed
fish progenitors. Somewhere between the fishes and
the higher mammals, you have not only a great change in
the chemical composition of the blood-vessels and tissues,
but an equally great change in the apparatus by which the
blood is oxygenated.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> How can these changes have been
brought about without a new and intentional structure of
the vessels and the apparatus for supplying the oxygen demanded
for the continuation of life? How can we explain
these changes by such agencies as the natural selec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>tion
which is supposed to lead to the "survival of the
fittest," and the sexual selection which is supposed to give
to the best-appointed males of a given species the power to
transmit to their offspring the new peculiarities which they
have acquired through successive generations? Do not
these changes show that there is a line of division which
such agencies alone can not cross? Do they not clearly
point to the exercise of the creative power in a special
manner, and for special purposes? That power being once
exercised, the new chemical composition and mechanical
appliances being devised, the same "ideal plan" could be
carried through a new class of animals by a repetition
which is in accordance with the economy of Nature, and
which an infinite power could adapt to the formation of
animals, each of which was designed to perpetuate its own
species and no other. Hence we should expect to find in
the animals sharing in the same formation of the blood and
the vascular system a corresponding process of healing the
parts severed by a wound, and a continuous secretion from
such vessels as have not been cut away; but we should not
expect to find the stumps growing into a new and perfect
part, to take the place of what has been removed by amputation.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
We should expect to find the same drugs affecting
different animals of the same class alike; and when
the nervous system of a class of animals is upon the same
general plan, we should expect to find them similarly affected
by stimulants. But these resemblances do not
militate very strongly against the hypothesis of special
creations, when we consider that it is according to the
universal economy of the Omnipotent Creator to employ
the necessary, and no more than the necessary, power in
originating a plan that may be applied to the formation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
a distinct class of beings, and that his adaptations of this
plan to further and specific constructions of beings belonging
to a general class, but differing widely from each other,
are among the strongest and plainest proofs of his infinite
power and the nature of his methods.</p>

<p>In regard to the "rudiments" that are found in man,
the theory of Mr. Darwin can be best stated in his own
words: "In order to understand the existence of rudimentary
organs, we have only to suppose that a former
progenitor possessed the parts in question in a perfect state,
and that under changed habits of life they became greatly
reduced, either from simple disuse or through the natural
selection of those individuals which were least encumbered
with a superfluous part, aided by the other means previously
indicated."<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> But, in order to do justice to this theory,
it is necessary to repeat the description and operation of
the supposed agencies of natural and sexual selection.
Natural selection is an occurrence which takes place among
the individuals of a certain species in the struggle for existence,
whereby those who are best appointed secure the
necessary supply of food, and the weaker or less active are
either directly destroyed in the contest or perish for want
of nourishment. The "fittest" having survived, they have
the best chance of procreating their kind, and are likely to
have the most progeny. To these individuals there comes
in aid the sexual selection, which means chiefly the victory
of the fittest males over their less fit competitors for the
possession of the females. Whatever peculiarities of structure
or development, or diminution of structure or development,
these fittest males possess, they would transmit to
their offspring. This tendency would be enhanced by the
varying conditions of life through which the successive
generations might have to pass; so that if the former pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>genitor
possessed naturally an organ in a perfect state, but
ceased to make use of it, and for thousands of generations
its use went on diminishing, it would sink into the condition
of a mere rudiment. Supposing this to be a partially
true explanation of the modes in which organs become rudimentary,
how does it militate against the idea of separate
creations? We have "only to suppose" that the first men
possessed, for example, the power of moving the skin all
over their bodies by the contraction of certain muscles,
and that their remote descendants lost it everywhere excepting
in a few parts, where it remains in an efficient
state, and that it has become varied in different individuals.
The process by which organs become rudimentary is
an hypothesis just as consistent with the separate creation
of man as it is with his being a co-descendant from some
lower animal whose descendants branched into men, apes,
horses, seals, bats, etc.; for, on the supposition of the
separate creation of all these different animals, each species
might have been originally endowed with this power of
muscular contraction of the skin, and in their descendants it
might have been retained or varied or have become more or
less rudimentary, according to its utility to the particular
species. The truth is, that our own faculties of creation or
construction, when we undertake to deal with matter and
its properties, are so imperfect, and that which constitutes
living organisms is so utterly beyond our reach, that we do
not sufficiently remember how entirely it is within the
compass of the infinite Power, which has given to matter
all the properties that it possesses and has living organisms
under its absolute control, to form a system of construction
and operation for beings of entirely distinct characters, carrying
it through each of them in parallel lines, or causing
it to diverge into varying results with an economy that
neither wastes the constructive power nor fails to exert it
where it is needed. To argue that the presence of rudi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>ments
in different animals, in different comparative states
of development or efficiency, or in a purely useless condition,
can only be explained by a descent from some remote
common progenitor, is what the logicians call a <i lang="la">non sequitur</i>.
It overlooks the illimitable faculty of the creating
Power, and disregards the great fact that such a power acts
by an economy that is saving where uniformity will accomplish
what is intended, that is profuse where variation is
needful, and that can guide its own exertions of power, or
its abstention from such exertions, by unerring wisdom, to
the most varied and exact results.</p>

<p>I trust that by the use of the term "economy" in speaking
of what is observable in the works of the Creator, I
shall be understood as comprehending both the avoidance
of unnecessary and the exertion of all necessary power. Of
the degree of necessity in any exercise of a power which we
suppose to be infinite, we can only judge by what we can
see. If omnipotence and omniscience are to be predicated
of the being who is supposed to preside over the universe,
it is rational to conclude, from all that we can discover,
that, in applying a uniform system of construction to different
animals of a certain general class, he acted upon a principle
that his unerring faculties enabled him to see was a
comprehensive one; and that in producing variations of
that system of construction that would result in adapting
its uniformity to the varying conditions of the different
species, he acted by the same boundless wisdom and power.
If these postulates of the Divine attributes are conceded,
rudiments do not by any means necessarily lead to the conclusion
that all the animals of a certain class are co-descendants
from some remote common progenitor, for they do not
exclude the hypothesis that each distinct animal was formed
upon a general plan of construction that could be applied
throughout the class, but that it was varied according to
the special conditions of its intended being. Organs or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
parts may thus have become more or less rudimentary without
resorting to the supposition of a common progenitor for
the whole class. That supposition, indeed, makes it necessary
to assume that the infinite Creator fashioned some one
animal, and then, abstaining from all work of further direct
creation, left all the other animals to be evolved out of
that one by the operation of secondary causes that fail even
as a theory to account for what we see, and that can not be
traced through any results that have yet been discovered.
Wherever we pause in the ascending scale of the Darwinian
descent of man, wherever we place the first special act of
creative power, whether we put it at the fish-like animal
of the most remote antiquity, and call that creature the
original progenitor of all the vertebrata, or whether we
suppose a special creation to have occurred at the introduction
of the mammalian series, or anywhere else, we
have to account for changes of system, new constructions,
elaborately diversified forms, by the operation of agencies
that were incapable of producing the results, if we are to
judge of their capacity by anything that we have seen or
known of their effects.</p>

<p>I will conclude this chapter by expressing as accurately
as I can what has struck me as the excessive tendency of
modern science to resolve everything into the operation of
general laws, or into what we call secondary causes. I may
be able to suggest nothing new upon this part of the subject,
but I shall at least be able, I hope, to put my own
mind in contact with that of the reader by explaining what
has impressed me in the speculations of those who lay so
much stress upon the potency of general laws to produce
the results which we see in Nature. Of course, I do not
question the great fact that the infinite Power acts by and
through the uniform methods from which we are accustomed
to infer what we call laws; which in physics is nothing
but a deduction of regularity and system from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
which we see to be perpetually and invariably happening.
Now, I do not enter here into the question of the tendency
of modern science to displace our religious ideas of a special
Providence, by attributing everything in Nature to the
operation of fixed laws of matter; or its tendency, in other
words, to remove the infinite Being at a greater distance
from us than that in which our religious feelings like to
contemplate him. I am perfectly sensible that in truth the
infinite God is just as near to us, when we regard him as
acting by general laws and secondary causes, as when we believe
him to be exercising a direct and special power. I am
equally sensible that it is in the very nature of infinite power,
wisdom, and benevolence to be able and willing to ordain
uniform and fixed principles of action. That Power which
gives to matter all its properties may well be supposed to
have established uniformity and regularity of movements,
forces, combinations, and qualities. How supremely consistent
this uniformity and regularity are, with what stupendous
accuracy they are kept forever in operation, we are
more or less able to discern; and that benevolence which is
believed to accompany the power may well be supposed
to have intended that its intelligent and rational creatures
should be able in some degree to discover and to avail themselves
of these unvarying laws of the physical world. But
are these laws to be supposed to be the only methods by
which the infinite Will has ever acted? Is it to be assumed
that, having settled and established these perpetual principles,
on which matter, organized or unorganized, is to act,
he leaves everything to their operation and abstains from
all further exertion of his creative power for any special
purpose? Has he given to these general laws a potency to
produce, in and of themselves, all the results? In other
words, has he affixed to their operation no limitations, or
has he set bounds to them, and reserved to himself, by direct,
specific, and occasional exercise of his will and power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
for new purposes, to produce results for which the general
laws were not ordained?</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to enter into the consideration
of what are called "miracles." These, in their true meaning,
are special interpositions, which the Divine Power is
supposed to make, by a suspension or interruption of the
established laws of Nature; and, whatever may be the
grounds of our belief or our unbelief in such occurrences,
they are not exercises of power such as those which are supposed
to take place in special creations of new beings. That
the hypothesis of special creations of new beings involves
no interruption or displacement of the fixed laws of Nature,
is quite manifest.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note A.</span></p>



<p><span class="smcap">Note on Amputation, or Severance of Parts.</span>&mdash;As Mr. Darwin attached
some importance to a fact which he asserted respecting the efforts
of Nature to restore a part of an organism which has been severed by
amputation, I think it well to quote his statement, and to point out what
I believe to be an inaccuracy. His statement is this: "His [man's]
wounds are repaired by the same process of healing, and the stumps left
after the amputation of his limbs, especially during an early embryonic
period, occasionally possess some power of regeneration, as in the lowest
animals." It is not quite apparent what he means by amputation during
an early embryonic period. If he is to be understood as referring to a case
of complete severance of any part of an embryo before birth, it has not
been demonstrated that such a severance has been followed by a successful
effort of Nature to replace the severed part; and it is difficult to understand
how there could be such an amputation during embryonic life without
destroying the life of the embryo; or, if the severed part were one of the
extremities, how there could be a new extremity formed. In such a case,
if life continued and birth were to take place, the animal must be born in
an imperfect state. In regard to amputations taking place at any time
after birth, if the expression "some power of regeneration" means to imply
a new formation to take the place of the severed part, the assertion is not
correct. What occurs in such cases may be illustrated by the very common
accident of the severance of the end of a human finger at the root of the
nail. If the incision is far enough back to remove the whole of the vessels
which secrete the horny substance that forms the nail, there will be no <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>after growth
of anything resembling a nail. If some of those vessels are left in
the stump, there will be continuous secretion and deposit of the horny substance,
which may go so far as to form a crude resemblance to a nail. But
if all the vessels which constitute the means of perpetuating a perfect nail
are not left in their normal number and action, there can be no such thing
as the formation of a new nail. Whether it is correct to speak of the imperfect
continuation of a few of the vessels to secrete the substance which
it is their normal function to secrete, as a "power of regeneration," is more
than doubtful, if by such a power is meant a power to make a new and complete
structure to take the place of the structure that has been cut away.
It is nothing more than the continued action of a few vessels, less in number
than the normal system required for the continued growth and renewal
of the part in question. The abortive product in such cases looks like an unsuccessful
effort of Nature to make a new structure in place of the old one;
but it is not in reality such an effort. The fact that the same thing occurs,
in just the same way and to a corresponding extent, in different animals, has
no tendency to prove anything excepting that these different animals share
the same general system of secreting vessels for the formation and perpetuation
of the several parts of their structures. It has no tendency to prove
that they are co-descendants from a common ancestral stock, for on the
hypothesis of their special and independent creation a common system of
secreting vessels would be entirely consistent with their peculiar and special
constructions.</p></blockquote>

</div>


<p class="intro">The doctrine of evolution according to Herbert Spencer.</p>


<p>Passing from Mr. Darwin as the representative of that
class of naturalists who have undertaken to assign the pedigree
of man by tracing the stages of his development back
to the lowest and crudest form of animal life, I now come
to a philosopher whose speculations carry the doctrine of
evolution through every field of inquiry, and who, finding,
as he supposes, evidence of its operation throughout all the
other realms of the physical and the moral word, contends
that it also obtains in the animal kingdom. It were to be
wished that this writer, whose intellect is of the order of
minds to which we naturally look for a judicial treatment
of such themes, had been a little less dogmatic in his treatment
of the doctrine of special creations. Mr. Spencer has,
indeed, consistently recognized the necessity of trying the
question between the hypothesis of special creations and
the hypothesis of evolution, as one to be decided, if it is to
be decided at all, only by an examination of evidence. But
to one who approaches this question in a spirit of inquiry,
and with a desire to learn whatever can be said on both
sides, it is somewhat disappointing to find that the most
eminent writer of the evolution school is unjust in his
treatment of the belief which he opposes. There can be
no objection to advocacy, or to strong and decided advocacy,
when settled convictions are to be vindicated. But
with advocacy we may expect that kind of fairness which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
consists in a full recognition of the opposite argument. A
great master of dialectics once laid it down as a maxim of
advocacy, "State the case of your opponent as strongly as
you know how, stronger if possible than he states it himself,
and then answer it, if you can." Some instances in
which Mr. Spencer has not followed this wise rule may
now be mentioned:</p>

<p>1. He attacks with great vigor the hypothesis that living
beings resulted from special creations, as a primitive
hypothesis; and because it is a very ancient belief he pronounces
it to be probably untrue. He even goes so far as
to assert that its antiquity raises a presumption against it.
He classes it among a family of beliefs which began in
primitive ages, and which have one after another been destroyed
by advancing knowledge, until this one is almost
the only member of the family that survives among educated
people.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> He says that if you catechise any one who holds
this belief as to the source from which he derived it, he is
forced to confess that it was put into his mind in childhood,
as one portion of a story which, as a whole, he has
long since rejected. It will give way at last, along with all
the rest of the family of beliefs which have already been
given up. It may be that the arguments of those whose
controversial writings on this subject Mr. Spencer had before
him, relied on the antiquity of this belief as one of the
strongest proofs of its probable truth. I have not looked
to see how any writer on that side of the question has used
the antiquity of the doctrine of special creations. But it
is certainly not in accordance with the sound rule, even of
advocacy, to state the argument in support of the belief
which you oppose with less than the force that may be
given to it, whether your opponents have or have not given
to it the true force that belongs to it. The mere antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
of the belief in special creations has this force and no more:
that a belief which began in the primitive ages of mankind,
and has survived through all periods of advancing knowledge,
must have something to recommend it. It is not
one of those things that can be swept away with contempt
as a nursery-tale, originating in times of profound ignorance
and handed down from generation to generation without
inquiry. That it has survived, after the rejection of
other beliefs that originated at the same period&mdash;survived
in minds capable of dealing with the evidence in the light
of increasing knowledge&mdash;is proof that it has something
more to rest upon than the time of its origin. If some of
its defenders now assert its antiquity as the sole or the
strongest argument in its favor, its opponents should not
assume that this is the only or the best argument by which
it can be supported. Nor can it be summarily disposed of
by classifying it as one of a family of beliefs that originated
in times of ignorance, and that have mostly disappeared
from the beliefs held by educated people. Its association
with a special class of mistaken beliefs affords no intrinsic
improbability of its truth. Every belief has come to be
regarded as a mistaken or a true one, not according to its
associated relations with other beliefs that have come to be
regarded as unfounded, but according to the tests that the
knowledge of the age has been able to apply to it. Take
the whole catalogue of beliefs that began to be held in the
darkest ages, and it will be found that their association has
had no influence beyond inducing incorrect habits of reasoning
on certain subjects, or a habit of accepting the official
authority of those who claimed to be the special custodians
of truth. These intellectual habits have been temporary
in their influence, and have gradually changed.
Every one of the beliefs that have been given up by the lettered
or the unlettered part of mankind, has been given up
because better knowledge of a special character has come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
to show that it is unfounded, and because mere official authority
has ceased to have the power that it once had. If
a belief has survived from a remote antiquity among those
who are competent to judge of the evidence in its favor, by
comparing the phenomena that increasing knowledge has
accumulated, the force of the fact that it has so survived
is not weakened by its association for a period with other
beliefs that are now rejected.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer asserts that, as the supposition of special
creations is discredited by its origin in a time when men
were profoundly ignorant, so conversely the supposition
that races of organisms have been gradually evolved is credited
by its origin, because it is a belief that has come into
existence in the most instructed class, living in these better
instructed times. This is a kind of argumentation that is
often the result of a love of antithesis. The soundness of
the last branch of the proposition appears to depend upon
the soundness of the first branch. Make it to appear that
the origin of the elder hypothesis is unfavorable by reason
of the time of its origin, and it seems to follow that the
origin of the modern hypothesis is favorable by reason of
its time of origin. But this antithesis does not express the
exact truth in either branch of it. It is not because of its
antiquity, or of the character of the times in which it was
first believed, that the doctrine of special creations can be
shown to be irrational or improbable. There is no presumption
against the truth of any belief, to be derived
from the fact that it was held by persons who also held
some erroneous beliefs on other subjects. If there were,
nothing could be worthy of belief unless it could show a
recent origin, or at least until demonstration of its truth
had overcome the presumption against it. On the other
hand, there is no presumption in favor of the truth of a
new theory to be derived from the fact that it is new, or
that it originated among those who think that they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
hold any erroneous beliefs, or because it originated in a
comparatively very enlightened age. Every physical and
every moral theory, unless we mean to be governed by mere
authority, whether it is ancient or recent, must be judged
by its merits, according to the evidence.</p>

<p>2. Another of Mr. Spencer's naked assertions is that the
belief in special creations is "not countenanced by a single
fact." Not only did no man "ever see a special creation,"
but "no one ever found indirect proof of any kind that a
special creation had taken place." In support of this sweeping
dogma, he adduces a habit of the naturalists who maintain
special creations to locate them in some region remote
from human observation.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> This is another instance of not
stating the case of your adversary as strongly as you might
state it, or as he states it himself. "While no naturalist and
no other person who believes in special creations ever saw
one take place, indirect and circumstantial evidence tending
to show that the earth is full of them has been accumulated
to an enormous amount." It is a monstrous extravagance
to assert that the hypothesis is "absolutely without
support of any kind." What if Mr. Spencer's opponents
were to retort that no man ever saw an instance in which
an animal of a distinct species had been evolved out of one
of an entirely different organization; that there is no external
evidence to support the hypothesis of such derivations,
and that the naturalists of the evolution school habitually
place the scene of operations in the region of scientific
imagination? The discovery of truth is not likely to
be much advanced by this mode of attacking opposite opinions,
yet it could be used with as much propriety on the
one side of this question as on the other.</p>

<p>3. Next, and completing the misrepresentation, we have
the assertion that, "besides being absolutely without evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>dence
to give it external support, this hypothesis of special
creations can not support itself internally&mdash;can not be
framed into a coherent thought.... Immediately an attempt
is made to elaborate the idea into anything like definite
shape, it proves to be a pseud-idea, admitting of no
definite shape. Is it supposed that a new organism when
specially created is created out of nothing? If so, there is
a supposed creation of matter, and the creation of matter
is inconceivable, implies the establishment of a relation in
thought between nothing and something&mdash;a relation of
which one term is absent&mdash;an impossible relation....
Those who entertain the proposition that each kind of organism
results from divine interposition do so because they
refrain from translating words into thoughts. The case is
one of those where men do not really believe, but <em>believe
they believe</em>. For belief, properly so called, implies a mental
representation of the thing believed; and no such mental
representation is here possible."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>When I first read this passage I could hardly trust
the evidence of my eye-sight. It seemed as if the types
must have in some way misrepresented the distinguished
writer; for I could scarcely conceive how a man of Mr.
Spencer's reputation as a thinker could have deliberately
penned and published such a specimen of logic run riot.
It reads like some of the propositions propounded by the
scholastics of the middle ages. But, having assured myself
that the American edition of his work is a correct reprint,
and having carefully pondered and endeavored to
ascertain his meaning, I was forced to the conclusion that
he supposes this to be a conclusive answer to the idea of
absolute creation in respect to anything whatever, because,
when put into a logical formula, one term of the relation
is nothing, and the other term is something. Logical for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>mulas
are not always the best tests of the possibility of an
intellectual conception, or of what the mind can represent
to itself by thought, although to a certain class of readers
or hearers they often appear to be a crushing refutation of
the opposite opinion or belief against which they are employed.</p>

<p>Is there in truth anything impossible because it is unthinkable
in the idea of absolute creation? Is the creation
of matter, for example, inconceivable? It certainly is not
if we adopt the postulate of an infinite Creator. That postulate
is just as necessary to the evolutionist who maintains
the ordination of fixed laws or systems of matter, by the
operation of which the organized forms of matter have
been evolved, as it is to those who maintain that these
forms are special creations. Who made the laws that have
been impressed upon matter? Were they made at all, or
were they without any origin, self-existing and eternal?
If they were made, they were made out of nothing, for
nothing preceded them. Then apply to them the logical
formula, and say that one term of the relation is absent&mdash;is
mere nothingness&mdash;and so there is an impossible relation,
a relation in thought between nothing and something, which
is inconceivable. This dilemma is not escaped by asserting,
as Mr. Spencer does, that "the creation of force is
just as inconceivable as the creation of matter." It is necessary
to inquire what he means by a "conceivable" idea.
If he means that we can not trace or understand the process
by which either force or matter was created, our inability
may be at once conceded. But if he means that, granting
the postulate of an infinite creating power, we can not conceive
of the possibility that matter and all the forces that
reside in it or govern it were called into being by the will of
that power, the assertion is not true. Human faculties are
entirely equal to the conception of an infinite creating power,
whatever may be the strength or the weakness of the proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
by which the existence of such a power is supported; and
if there is such a power it is a contradiction in terms to
assert that absolute creation, or the formation of "something"
out of "nothing," is an impossible conception.
Such an assertion is simply a specious play upon words, or
else it involves the negation of an infinite creating power.
The term "creation," as used in all modern philosophy,
implies, <i lang="la">ex vi termini</i>, the act of causing to exist; and,
unless we assume that nothing which exists was ever caused
to exist, we must suppose that the causing power was alike
capable of giving existence to matter and to the forces that
reside in it.</p>

<p>The reason why the Greek philosophers did not embrace
the idea of absolute creation was not because it was an
unthinkable idea, or one incapable of representation in
thought. They were, as we have seen, surrounded by a
mythology which attributed the origin of the world to
polytheistic agencies. They struggled against the cosmogony
of poetical and popular traditions in an effort to find
a cause of a different character. Monotheism, the conception
of the one only and omnipotent God, freed philosophy
from the great want which had hampered its speculations.
This want was the conception of divine power, as abstracted
from substance or the qualities of substance. When this
conception had been obtained, absolute creation was seen to
be a legitimate deduction from the illimitable scope and
nature of the power which monotheism imputed to the
Being supposed to preside over the universe, and to have
existed before all the objects which the universe contains:
and this conception of the act of creation thus became
equally capable of representation in words and in thought.
You may say that it has no evidence to support it; that it
leads to contradictory ideas of the attributes claimed for the
Creator; that upon the hypothesis of those attributes, his
works are inexplicable. Whether you can say this truly or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
not, you can not say that absolute creation is inconceivable;
and unless you mean to claim that neither matter nor force
was ever created, that there never was a being competent to
make either the one or the other to exist, you can not deny
the probability that both were called into being by a definite
and specific exercise of power. Mr. Spencer's philosophy
manifestly leads to the conclusion that there is no God, or
no such God as the hypothesis of special creations supposes,
or such as the hypothesis of evolution necessarily calls for.
If I understand him rightly, he rejects the idea of any creation,
whether of matter, or force, or the properties of
matter, or even of law of any kind, physical or moral.
Hence it is that I admit the necessity of treating the existence
of the Omnipotent Creator as an independent question
to be judged upon moral evidence; and hence, too, in reasoning
upon the probable methods of the Almighty, I maintain
that the postulate of his existence is alike necessary to
the evolutionist and to those who believe in special creations,
and that both must adopt the same cardinal attributes
as attributes of his power and character.</p>

<p>It is well to pursue this particular topic somewhat further,
because this special difficulty arising from the creation
of something out of nothing, triumphantly propounded by
a certain class of philosophers, is echoed by others as if it
concluded the question. The received meaning of language
is often a great help to the mind in representing to itself in
thought the idea that is expressed by the word. The word
contains and suggests the thought. Lexicographers are the
learned persons, one part of whose business it is to exhibit
the thought that is represented by a word, not according to
the popular and, perhaps, uncertain or erroneous use of the
term, or according to its secondary meanings, but according
to the exact correspondence between the word and the
idea which it conveys in its primary and philosophic usage.
The definition given to our English verb "create," in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
primary and philosophical sense, is: "To produce," "to
bring into being from nothing"; "to cause to exist."
"Creation," as a noun expressing the act described by the
verb, is defined as "the act of creating: the act of causing
to exist, and <em>especially</em>, the act of bringing this world into
existence." "Created," as the past participle which describes
what has been done, is defined as "formed from nothing:
caused to exist; produced; generated."<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> This is the
sense in which the word is used in the English version of the
first verse of the book of Genesis: "In the beginning God
<em>created</em> the heavens and the earth"; and whatever may be
said about the source from which Moses derived his knowledge
of the fact which he relates, there can be no doubt
about the nature of the fact which he intended to assert.
Now, does the lexicographer, when he describes creation as
the act of causing something to exist, or the act of producing
something out of nothing, present an idea that is incapable
of mental representation&mdash;a relation impossible in thought?
What he means to express is clear enough. Is the idea
which he expresses impossible to be conceived by the mind?</p>

<p>It will be a good test of this supposed insuperable difficulty
to apply the term "creation" to some human act.
When Shakespeare composed the tragedy of "Hamlet," he
created something in the sense which we are here considering.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
He created that something out of nothing: for he
caused something to exist which did not exist before. He
did not merely inscribe certain words upon paper, by the
material process of writing, and afterward cause the same
words to be repeated by the material process of printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
upon another paper. He gave intellectual existence to certain
male and female persons of his imagination, carried them
through certain periods of their imaginary lives, and made
them and their history an imperishable intellectual idea.
It is entirely immaterial to the present discussion that such
a product of the imagination presents to us nothing but
intellectual ideas; that Hamlet and Ophelia, and the King
and Queen, and all the rest of the <i lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>, were
mere creatures of the poet's fancy. Although they were
nothing but intellectual conceptions, they were "creations"
in the sense of being intellectual products that never existed
in idea before the poet made them, and therefore they were
made out of nothing. Now, although we can not look into
the mind of Shakespeare and describe the process by which
he formed these creatures of his imagination, we experience
no difficulty when we contemplate these imaginary personages,
in representing in thought what we mean when we
say that he "created" them. It would be simple absurdity
to say that he did not create these ideal persons, because
the notion of creation implies the formation of something
out of nothing. That is the very meaning of creation in
its primary and philosophical sense; and, when applied to
works of the human imagination, it presents to us an idea
that is perfectly capable of representation in thought.</p>

<p>Pass from this illustration of the idea of human creation
to the hypothesis of a supreme being, possessing infinite
power, and existing before the material universe began.
The hypothesis of his existence includes the power to call
into being things that had no previous being, whether these
things be matter and material properties or moral and intellectual
ideas. The whole realms of possible existence,
spiritual and material, the whole void which consists in
mere nothingness, are, according to the hypothesis, under
his absolute sway. He holds the power of absolute creation;
and the power this hypothesis imputes to him is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
more incapable of representation in thought than is the
inferior and limited power of creation, which we know to
be performed by the finite human intellect, and which we
have no difficulty in conceiving as a true creating faculty.
When Watt formed the steam-engine, he did something
more than to place certain portions of matter in certain
relations, and make them to operate in a certain manner so
as to produce a certain effect. He made the intellectual
plan of a certain arrangement of matter; and to this act of
giving being to something, both intellectual and physical,
which did not exist before, we ascribe in its true sense the
act of creation, and the idea we express by the term is perfectly
capable of mental representation.</p>

<p>"Those," says Mr. Spencer, "who entertain the proposition
that each kind of organism results from a divine interposition,
do so because they refrain from translating
words into thoughts"; and he adds, quite truly, that there
is no assignable mode or conceivable way in which the
making of a new organism can be described. Let this be
applied to some new mechanical structure produced by the
intellect and hand of man. It is a result or product of
human interposition. When we describe this human product
as an invention, do we refrain from translating words
into thoughts because we can not describe the process of
invention? or, in other words, because we can not assign
the mode in which the mind of the inventor reached his
conception, are we to conclude that he did not attain to
the conception which is plainly embodied in the machine
that stands before our eyes? If we say that he created
something, do we make a statement that can not be consistently
imagined because we can not assign the mode in
which his mind operated when it thought out the idea and
constructed the plan? We can see how he put together
certain material substances, and how they operate; but we
can not see or describe the mental process by which he ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>tained
his conception. Yet we ascribe to his act, and
rightly ascribe to it, the idea of creation; and the term
represents a thought of the mind that is as capable of being
imagined as the word is of being spoken and understood.</p>

<p>When Raphael painted the Sistine Madonna, he formed
in his mind an image of the heaven-chosen mother of
Christ, and the marvelous skill of his artist hand transferred
that face of surpassing loveliness to the canvas. The
story that it tells may be a fiction or a fact. The image is
a reality. It was a new existence; and, if we call it a creation,
do we use a word which we can not translate into
thought because we do not know how the painter attained
to that sweet conception of the human mother's tenderness,
and the dignity of her appointed office as the handmaiden
of the Lord?</p>

<p>There is nothing unphilosophical in thus ascribing what
is done by finite human faculties and what is done by the
infinite Creator to a power that is of the same nature, but
which in the one being is limited and imperfect, and in the
other is superhuman and boundless. If we know, as we
certainly do, that weak and finite man can perform some
acts of creation, can cause some things to exist that did not
previously exist, how much more may we safely conclude
that a being of infinite powers can call into existence, out
of the primeval nothingness, objects of the most stupendous
proportions, of the nicest adaptations, of the most palpable
uses&mdash;can cause matter and force and law to be where before
all was vacuity, where force was unknown, where law
had never operated! When the mind contemplates that
Omnipotent Power, it reaches forth to an awful presence;
but it does not contemplate something of which it can not
conceive, for its own inferior faculties teach it that creation
is a possible occurrence.</p>

<p>We do not need to be and are not indebted to superstition,
to tradition, or to deceptive words, for the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
creation. At an immeasurable distance from the Almighty
Power, we ourselves are constantly creating; and it is when
we do so that our acts resemble his in their nature, however
below his productions may be the productions of our poor
human faculties. It is one of the proofs of our relationship
to the infinite Creator, a proof for which we are not
indebted solely to revelation, that we are endowed in this
imperfect degree with a power that resembles his. It is
also one of the chief of the characteristics that distinguish
man from the other animals: for, wonderful as are the
constructions made by some of them, they are uniformly
made under the involuntary and uncontrollable impulse of
an implanted instinct; whereas, the constructions of man
are made by the exercise of a constructive faculty that is
guided by his will, which enables him to effect variations
of structure entirely unattainable by any other being that
exists on this earth. All the other animals are confined in
the exercise of their constructive faculties to an invariable
model, appointed for each of them according to the circumstances
of its being. The range of choice is bounded by
the limitations of the instinct under which the animal is
compelled to do its work. It may appear to select a favorable
site for its habitation, to cull its materials with judgment,
to guard against disturbance from the elements or
from enemies. But we have not much reason to suppose
that any of these things are done from anything but an
irresistible impulse, and we certainly have no reason to suppose
that the animal has the moral power to do them or to
refrain from them. To man alone does there appear to
have been given the power of varying his constructions by
the exercise of an intelligent will; and that will is bounded
only by the limitations of his power over matter: so that,
in respect to material structures, the power of man to make
creations approaches nearest to the power of the Almighty
Creator, and is, within its limitations, a true creating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
power. In the realm of intellectual or ideal creations, the
resemblance of human and divine power is the same, and
the limitations upon the former are those fixed by the finite
nature of human faculties.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>4. Mr. Spencer has a great deal to urge against "the
current theology," and he treats of some of the theological
difficulties in which those who espouse the hypothesis of
special creations entangle themselves.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> I have nothing to
do with the current theology. I do not borrow from it or
rely upon it, and do not undertake to disentangle its professors
from any of the difficulties in which they may have
involved themselves. The only question that interests me
is, whether the objections propounded by this philosopher
as an answer to the hypothesis of special creations present
insuperable difficulties to one who does not depend upon
the current theology for arguments, explanations, or means
of judgment. I shall therefore endeavor to state fairly and
fully the chief of the supposed difficulties, without considering
the answer that is made to them by those who are
taken as the representatives of the current theology.</p>

<p>Put into a condensed form, one of Mr. Spencer's grand
objections to the belief in special creations of organized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
beings is that it involves a deliberate intention on the part
of the Creator to produce misery, suffering, pain, and an
incalculable amount of evil, or else that there was an inability
to prevent these results. Omitting for the present
the human race, and confining our first view to the other
animals, the earth is largely peopled by creatures which
inflict on each other and on themselves a vast amount of
suffering. The animals are endowed with countless different
pain-inflicting appliances and instincts; the earth has
been a scene of warfare among all sentient creatures; and
geology informs us that, from the earliest eras which it
records, there has been going on this universal carnage.
Throughout all past time there has been a perpetual preying
of the superior upon the inferior&mdash;a ceaseless devouring
of the weak by the strong. In almost every species, the
number of individuals annually born is such that the majority
die of starvation or by violence before arriving at
maturity. But this is not all. Not only do the superior
animals prey upon the inferior, for which there may be
suggested some compensating benefit by the sustentation
of a higher order of life through the death of the lower, or
by leaving the most perfect members of a species to continue
that species, but the inferior prey upon the superior,
and organisms that are incapable of feeling have appliances
for securing their prosperity at the expense of misery to
organisms capable of happiness. Of the animal kingdom,
as a whole, more than half, it is said, are parasites, and
almost every known animal has its peculiar species. Passing
over the evils thus inflicted on animals of inferior dignity
and coming to man, we find that he is infested by
animal and vegetable parasites of which two or three dozens
may be distinctly enumerated; which are endowed with
constitutions fitting them to live by absorbing the juices
of the human body, furnished with appliances by which
they root themselves in the human system, and made pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>lific
in an almost incredible degree. They produce great
suffering, sometimes cause insanity, and not infrequently
death.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The dilemma that is supposed to be created by these
facts for those who believe in the doctrine of special creations
is this: If any animals are special creations, all are
so; and each animal must be supposed to have been created
for the special purposes that are apparent upon an examination
of its structure and mode of life. As the superior
are constantly preying upon the inferior, and as there are
numerous inferior animals that are constantly inflicting evil
upon the superior, it results that malevolence rather than
benevolence was a characteristic attribute of the creating
power, or else that the power which is supposed to have
created was unable to make the perfect creation which the
hypothesis of infinite benevolence calls for. Infinite goodness
fails to be demonstrated by a world that is full of
misery, caused by special appliances to bring it about; and
infinite power can not have existed, unless it comprehended
the power to produce perfect and universal happiness.</p>

<p>I pass entirely aside from the argument which is drawn
from the supposed manifestations of Almighty power in the
creation of diversified forms of animal and vegetable life,
because that argument leads doubtless to the inquiry whether
the Almighty made these manifestations to demonstrate
his power to himself, or made them to demonstrate it to
his human creatures. Admitting the fact, as Mr. Spencer
puts it, that millions of these demonstrations took place on
earth when there were no intelligent beings to contemplate
them&mdash;a statement that is said to be verified by the deductions
of geology and paleontology&mdash;an inquiry into the
period or the purpose of these manifestations of divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
power as manifestations only, merely leads us into some of
the arguments of the current theology. There is another
realm of thought and reasoning into which it will be far
more profitable to enter. It is that realm which lies outside
of tradition and the teachings of theologians, and
which takes the hypothesis of infinite power and infinite
goodness, not as something which we have been taught to
believe, but as a postulate of philosophical reasoning; and,
applying this hypothesis to the known facts of the animal
and vegetable world, endeavors to ascertain whether these
facts necessarily create an insuperable difficulty in the hypothesis
which lies at the basis of all sound reasoning on
the subject. For I must again insist, and shall endeavor
specifically to show, that this hypothesis of infinite power
and goodness is equally necessary to the evolutionist and
to the believer in special creations, unless all speculation
on the genesis of the world is to end in blind chance, and
the negation of a personal creating power of any kind.</p>

<p>What, then, is the true philosophical mode of dealing
with the existence in the world of physical and moral evil,
in reference to the hypothesis of infinite power and infinite
goodness? I do not ask what is a perfect demonstration
of the problem of physical and moral evil&mdash;although I
think that the natural solution is very near to demonstration;
but the inquiry which I now make is. What is the
reasonable mode of comparing the existence of suffering,
pain, misery, and their immediate agencies, with the supposition
of an all-wise, all-powerful, and perfectly beneficent
Creator?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>What we have to do, in the first place, is to contemplate
the scope of infinite goodness; or, in other words, to consider
that infinite benevolence is, in its very nature, guided
by unerring wisdom, and consequently that its methods,
its plans, and its results are as far beyond the methods,
plans, and results which our imperfect benevolence would
adopt or achieve, as infinite power is beyond our finite and
imperfect capacity. This does not call upon us to conceive
of something that is inconceivable, or that can not be represented
in thought; for power and goodness are qualities
that we know to exist: we know that they exist in degrees;
and that what exists in a measurable and limited degree
may exist without measurable limitation, or in absolute
perfection. The philosophic mode of regarding perfect
goodness requires us to consider its methods and results
with reference to its perfect character, and not to measure
them by the inferior standards of human wisdom. Following
out this obvious truth, we have next to inquire whether
the physical and moral evil which we see ought to destroy
the very idea of an infinitely benevolent Creator, and to
compel us to regard him as a malevolent being, or else to
destroy our belief in his infinite power, because his power
has been unable to make a world of perfect happiness and
enjoyment for his creatures. If this dilemma seriously
exists, it is just as great a difficulty for the hypothesis of
evolution as it is for that of special creations, and it drives
both schools into the utter negation of any intelligent
causing power adequate to produce what we see.</p>

<p>In the next place, let us see what is the sum total of
the physical and moral evil in the animal kingdom, which,
in reference to the sum total of happiness, is supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
create this formidable impeachment of the Almighty benevolence
on the one hand, or of the Almighty power on the
other. As to the order of things which permits the superior
animals to prey upon the inferior, there is an explanation
which lies on the surface of the facts, and which
would seem to satisfy all the requirements of philosophic
reasoning, whatever may be the mode in which this part
of the moral problem is dealt with by theologians. We
find the fact to be that, as we rise higher and higher in
the scale of organized beings, the superior are capable of
happiness in a greater degree than the inferior, in some
proportion to the superiority of their organization. The
comparative duration of life among the different animals
also enters into the estimate of the sum total of happiness.
As a general rule, the inferior organizations are individually
more short-lived than the superior. Now, it might
have pleased the Creator to cause all animals to be fed
by manna from heaven, or to find their sustenance only
in vegetable products; and he could thus have dispensed
with the carnivorous appetite, and have rendered it unnecessary
for the superior to prey upon and destroy the inferior.
But, although he could thus have made a world from
which the misery of this perpetual carnage would have
been absent, and which would have been so far a world of
perfect happiness, the fact is that this law of universal destruction
is so shaped as to follow the increasing capacity
for happiness and enjoyment which moves through the ascending
scale of the organized beings. It also follows another
obvious purpose of the carnivorous appetite and of
the permission to indulge it. A large part of the whole
animal kingdom is so constructed that sustentation requires
animal food. The blood, the tissues, the whole substance
of some animal structures require to be renewed by similar
substances; and although life may sometimes be continued
by the assimilation of vegetable substances alone, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the life for which the animal was formed, because it is not
always the life which makes the full end of its being, and
realizes its best capacity for enjoyment and for the continuation
of its species. In some cases, the carnivorous appetite
is withheld. The animal lives and thrives best upon a
vegetable diet, and so far as the flesh of these animals enters
into the wholesome and beneficial food of man, the
animal fulfills one purpose of its existence. Some animals,
before they become fit food for man, have been nourished
by the substance of still other animals. In all this variety
of modes in which animal food is prepared for man, and in
the whole of the stupendous economy by which the superior
organizations prey upon the inferior in order that each
species may continue itself and may fulfill the purposes of
its existence, we may without any difficulty trace an obvious
reason for the permission that has been given to such destruction
of individual life. When to the sum total of happiness
and benefit which this permission bestows on each of the
orders of the inferior animals according to its capacity for
enjoyment, whether it does or does not enter into the food
of man, whether it comes or never comes within the reach
of his arm, we add the sum total of happiness and benefit
which this law of universal destruction bestows on man, so
far as he avails himself of it, we shall find no reason to impeach
the Divine Goodness or to adopt a conclusion derogatory
to the Infinite Power. We may dismiss the difficulty
that is supposed to arise from the warfare of the superior
upon the inferior beings, because that warfare, when we
trace it through all its stages, involves no sort of deduction
from the perfect character of the Divine Goodness or the
Divine Power.</p>

<p>Next, we come to the liability of animals, man included,
to be preyed upon by parasites, creatures of a very inferior
order when compared to the animals which they infest. I
have looked in vain through Mr. Spencer's speculations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
any explanation which makes the existence of the parasitic
animals a support to the theory of evolution without involving
the same impeachment of the Divine Power or
the Divine Goodness which is supposed to be involved in the
hypothesis of special creations. We are indeed told that
evolution brings about an increasing amount of happiness,
all evils being but incidental; that, applying alike to the
lowest and to the highest forms of organization, there is
in all cases a progressive adaptation, and a survival of the
fittest. "If," it is argued, "in the uniform working of
the process, there are evolved organisms of low types, which
prey on those of higher types, the evils inflicted form but a
deduction from the average benefits. The universal and
necessary tendency toward supremacy and multiplication of
the best, applying to the organic creation as a whole as well
as to each species, is ever diminishing the damage done,
tends ever to maintain those most superior organizations
which, in one way or another, escape the invasions of the
inferior, and so tends to produce a type less liable to the
invasions of the inferior. Thus the evils accompanying
evolution are ever being self-eliminated."<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Admitting, for the argument's sake, that this is true,
how does the hypothesis of evolution meet the difficulty?
The parasitic inferior organizations exist, and they have
existed, more or less, as long as we have known anything
of the superior organizations on which they prey. They
have inflicted and still inflict an incalculable amount of
evil, an untold diminution of the happiness that might
have been enjoyed if they had never existed. The mode in
which they came into existence, whether by the process of
evolution or by special creations of their respective forms,
does not affect the amount of evil which their ravages have
produced and are still producing. If they exist under an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
order of things which has made them the products of an
evolving process that has formed them out of still lower
types, while they exist they have the same power of inflicting
evil as if they had been specially made in their respective
types without the former existence of any other type.
If they owe their existence to the process of evolution, they
exist under a system that was designed to lead to their
production by the operation of uniform laws working out
a uniform process; and under this process, so long as they
are produced by it, they imply gratuitous malevolence, just
as truly as they do if they are supposed to have been specially
created. The evils which they have inflicted and still
inflict were deliberately inflicted, unless we suppose that the
hypothetical process of evolution was not a system ordained
by any supreme and superhuman power, but was a result of
blind chance; that the system was not created, but, without
the volition of any power whatever, grew out of nothing.</p>

<p>The compensating tendency of the evolution system to
evolve superior organisms, which in one way or other "will
escape the parasitic invasions," by becoming less liable to
them, and so to diminish the damage done, as a sum total,
finds a corresponding result in the system of special creations
by a different process and at a more rapid rate. For
the hypothesis of special creations, rightly regarded, does
not assume the special creation of each individual animal
as a miraculous or semi-miraculous interposition of divine
power; and even when we apply it to the lowest types of
animals it implies only the formation of that type with the
power in most cases of continuing its species. Assuming
the parasitic animals to be in this sense special creations,
the superior organisms on which they prey during their
existence may become less liable to their invasions by an
infinity of causes which will diminish and finally put an
end to the parasitic ravages. In the progress of medical science
man may be wholly relieved from the worst and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
obscure parasites that have ever infested him, without waiting
for their evolution into some other type of animal that
does not desire or need to prey upon the human system, or
without waiting to have the human organism developed
into one that will not be exposed to such causes of suffering
or death. We know already that very simple precautions
will ward off from man some of the most subtle of these
enemies; and even in the case of animals lower than man
we know that instinct teaches them how to avoid the ravages
of some of the parasites to which they are exposed, even
if there are others which they can not now escape.</p>

<p>So that, viewing as a whole the amount of misery inflicted
by the inferior organisms upon the superior, and looking
from the first forward to the last "syllable of recorded
time," we are able upon either of the two hypotheses respecting
the origin of animals to reach certain definite conclusions,
which may be stated as follows: This world was
not intended to be a state of unmixed and unbroken individual
happiness for any of the animal organisms. Death
for every individual in some form was necessary to the carrying
on and the carrying out of the scheme of average enjoyment
and the accomplishment of a sum total of benefit
that becomes larger and larger as time goes on; and, although
death without suffering might have been ordained,
the moral purpose for which suffering was allowed to precede
death required that it should be permitted in numberless
cases and forms, and by almost numberless agencies,
although not always made necessary. This great purpose
can be discerned without taking into view at all the idea of
a future state of existence for man or any of the other terrestrial
beings, and looking only at the moral development
of man individually and collectively as an agent in the promotion
of happiness on this earth. Man, however he originated,
stands at the head of the whole animal kingdom.
If for himself and for all the inferior animal organisms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
death without suffering had been ordained as the universal
rule, he would have been without the full strength of the
moral stimulus which now leads him to relieve, to palliate,
to diminish, and, as far as possible, to terminate every kind
of suffering for himself and the superior organisms that are
below him in the scale, which are the most capable of enjoyment
and happiness, next after himself, in their various
proportionate capacities. He would have had no strong
motive for exterminating the inferior and noxious organisms
excepting for his own individual and immediate benefit;
no reason for extending the protection of his scientific
acquirements to the lower animals excepting to promote his
own immediate advantage. Human society would have
been without that approach to moral perfection which is
indicated by a tenderness for life in all its forms, where its
destruction is not needed by some controlling necessity or
expediency, and by the alleviation of suffering in all its
forms for the sake of increasing the sum total of possible
happiness. Human life itself would have been less sacred
in human estimation if there had been no suffering to draw
forth our sympathies and to stimulate us to the utmost contention
against its evils. Civilization would have been destitute
of that which is now its highest and noblest attribute.
Wars would have been more frequent among the
most advanced portions of the human race; pestilence
would not have been encountered with half the vigor or the
skill which now wage battle against it; poverty would have
been left to take care of itself, or would have been alleviated
from only the lowest and most selfish motives, which would
have left half its evils to be aggravated by neglect. As the
world has been constituted, and as we have the strongest
reason to believe it will continue to the end, there is to be
added to the immeasurable sum of mere animal enjoyment
of life that other immeasurable sum of moral happiness
which man derives from doing good and from the cultiva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>tion
of his power to do it&mdash;an acquisition and accumulation
of benefit which would have been wanting if there had
been no physical suffering to awaken pity and to prompt
our exertions for its relief.</p>

<p>So that the objection that the hypothesis of infinite
goodness required a world where physical pain would have
been unknown to any of its organisms, where human sorrow
would never have been felt, where human tears would
have never flowed, and where death would have been
always and only euthanasia, is by no manner of means a
necessary conclusion, as the existence of suffering is no impeachment
of the Infinite Power. If we consider man only
in the light of his rank at the head of all the terrestrial
beings, and as therefore capable of the greatest amount of
benefit, to himself and to the other creatures, and if we regard
him individually as nothing more than a being dwelling
on this earth for a short-lived existence and endowed
with the power of perpetuating his species, he would have
been morally an inferior being to what he is now capable
of becoming, and human society would have been far below
what it can be made and what we know that to a large
degree it already is, if physical suffering had been excluded
from the world. All this can be discerned without the aid
of revelation; it can be seen by the eye of philosophic reason
alone; and it is all equally true upon any hypothesis
of the physical origin of man or any other living creature
on this earth, unless we suppose that the whole animal
kingdom came into being without any intentional design,
without any plan of intentional benefit, without any purpose,
and without the conscious exertion of any power of
any kind.</p>

<p>And, if the question is asked, What is to be the end of
this world? or if we go forward in imagination toward the
probable end of all this animal life, I can not see that the
hypothesis of evolution has more to recommend it than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
hypothesis of special creations in reference to the perfectibility
of the world, or to the sum of approximate perfection
that seems to be attainable. As, upon either of the
two hypotheses, a perfect world does not even now seem to
have demanded an absence of suffering, since suffering tends
obviously to produce greater benefit than could have followed
from its absence, so, in the remotest conceivable future,
a nearer and nearer approximation to a state of universal
happiness will continue to be worked out by physical
and moral causes, which will be as potent under the system
of special creations as they can be supposed to be under the
system of evolution. It is true that the moral causes will
supplement and aid the physical under either of the two systems.
But one difficulty with the evolution theory as the
sole method by which the past or present inhabitants of the
world have come into existence is that, so far as we can
judge, it has done and completed its work just as effectually
and finally as special creation appears to have terminated
in certain forms, some of which are extinct and some
of which are living. Take the Darwinian pedigree of man,
as stated in a former chapter, or any other mode of tracing
the supposed stages of animal evolution. The process has
hypothetically culminated in man. At whatever species in
the ascending scale you pause, you find that the particular
type of animal has either become extinct or that it has continued
and still continues to be produced in that same type,
with only such variations and incidental differences as have
resulted from changed conditions of life, and from the intermingling
of different breeds of the same animal. I do
not now speak of the theory, which admits, of course, of
the hypothetical development of every known animal, past
or present, out of its supposed predecessors. But I speak
of the facts as yet revealed by the researches of naturalists
among all the extinct and living forms of animal life. If
there had ever been discovered any one instance in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
it could be claimed by satisfactory proof that an animal of
a distinct species had been evolved out of races of animals
of a fundamentally different organization, and without the
special interposition of any creating power operating to
make a new organism, we should certainly have it cited
and relied upon as a fact of the utmost importance. I do
not say that it would be reasonable to expect direct and
ocular demonstration of such a product, any more than it
would be reasonable to expect direct and ocular demonstration
of an act of special creation. But I say that it
could be shown by proofs that ought to be satisfactory if
there were any evidence from which the inference that
such a fact ever occurred could be reasonably drawn; just
as it is possible to draw the inference of special creation by
reasonable deduction from the evidence that tends to establish
it as a safe conclusion. But if there has ever been such
an instance of the evolution of any known species of animal
out of other species shown by satisfactory proof, or if
we assume such an occurrence in the past as the theory
calls for, what reason have we to suppose that the process
of evolution is still going on, and to expect it to go on to
the end of time? We must judge of the future by the
past, for we have no other means of judging it. The past
and the present both show, so far as we can yet perceive by
the facts, that each distinct and peculiar type of animal
life remains a perfect and completed production, however
it was fashioned or grew into that type; and that, so far as
we have any means of actual knowledge, no crosses of different
races of that animal produce anything but incidental
variations of structure and mode of life. It is a mere hypothesis
that they produce distinct species.</p>

<p>Apply this to the most important of the supposed connections
between different animals according to the theory
of evolution&mdash;that between man and the monkey. The
theory calls for the intermediate link or links. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
can be yet found that shows the pedigree without eking it
out by general reasoning, and by assumptions that are more
or less imaginary. But suppose that the chain of proof
were complete, what would it show? It would show that
the process of evolution has culminated in man, as its
crown and summit, and has there stopped. For, whatever
may have been the length of time required for the production
of this result, we know what the product is. We have
the history of man as an animal for a period of time that has
been quite long enough to show that, after he had become
in his essential structure as an animal what we know him
to be, no subsequent intermingling of the races or families
into which the species became divided has produced any
change in his essential structure, or any new organs or any
differences but differences in the development of powers
which are to be found in him at all the stages of his known
existence as parts of his characteristic animal structure.
The period of his known existence is certainly infinitely
small when compared with the whole indefinite future. It
is long enough, however, to afford some basis of reasoning
about the future; and, short as it is, it tends very strongly
to show that the further development of man on earth is
to be chiefly a moral and intellectual development; that
in physical structure he is a completed type; and that whatever
superiorities of mere animal life he may attain to hereafter
are to be such improvements as can be worked out,
within the limits of his animal constitution, by the science
which his accumulating experience and knowledge will enable
him to apply to the physical and moral well-being of
his race.</p>

<p>To return now to the line of thought from which these
suggestions have diverged. If, as we have every reason to
believe upon either hypothesis of man's origin, he is a completed
animal, standing by original creation or by the effect
of the evolution process at the head of the whole animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
kingdom in the apparent purpose of his existence, his
agency and his power in promoting the sum of happiness
on earth, for himself and all the other animals, are the
same upon either hypothesis of his origin. The hypothesis
of his origin by evolution gives him no greater power over
his own happiness or that of the other creatures than he
has if we suppose him to have been specially created; and
it is only by adopting the belief that in his own constitution
he is to be hereafter developed into a being incapable
of suffering, or one vastly less capable of suffering than the
animal called man now is, that the theory of evolution,
even in regard to the sum total of happiness on earth, has
any advantage over the theory of special creations. If we
suppose the future gradual development of a terrestrial
being standing still higher in the animal scale than man
now stands, exempt from the suffering which man now
suffers, we have a great amount of suffering hereafter
eliminated from the world by a certain process. But how
does this better satisfy the idea of infinite goodness in the
power that devised the process, than the hypothesis of
special creation which has formed man as an ultimate product
of the divine benevolence and power acting together,
endowed him with the faculty of eliminating pain and evil
from the circumstances of his existence, by his own exertions,
and furnished him with the strongest motives as well
as with almost immeasurable means for diminishing the
amount of evil for himself and all the other beings within
his reach?</p>

<p>5. Another of the specific objections urged by Mr. Spencer
against the doctrine of special creations is so put that
it is manifestly directed against one of the positions assumed
by the representatives of the current theology. The
learned philosopher begins this part of his argument by
imputing to those who assert this doctrine as their reason
for maintaining it, that it "honors the Unknown Cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
things," and that they think any other doctrine amounts
to an exclusion of divine power from the world. To encounter
this supposed reason for maintaining the doctrine
of special creations, he proceeds to ask whether the divine
power "would not have been still better demonstrated by
the separate creation of each individual than it is by the
separate creation of each species? Why should there exist
this process of natural generation? Why should not omnipotence
have been proved by the supernatural production
of plants and animals everywhere throughout the world
from hour to hour? Is it replied that the Creator was able
to make individuals arise from one another in natural selection,
but not to make species thus arise? This is to assign
a limit to power instead of magnifying it. Is it replied
that the occasional miraculous origination of a species was
practicable, but that the perpetual miraculous origination
of countless individuals was impracticable? This also is a
derogation. Either it was possible or not possible to create
species and individuals after the same general methods.
To say that it was not possible is suicidal in those who use
this argument; and, if it was possible, it is required to say
what end is served by the special creation of species that
would not be better served by the special creation of individuals?"<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
I must again disclaim any participation in the
views of those who contemplate this question with reference
to the manifestations of divine power by one method of its
supposed action or another, or who are influenced by the
idea of honoring or dishonoring the Creator. This is not
a question of the mode in which the Creator has chosen to
manifest his power for the purpose of making it more impressive
in the eyes of his intelligent human creatures
or more palpable to their perceptions. Nor is it a question,
excepting for the theologian who begins to reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
upon it from a peculiar point of view, by what belief we
best honor the Creator, or the power which Mr. Spencer
describes as the "Unknown Cause." In the eye of philosophic
reason, apart from all the religious dogmas that
have been taught by human interpretations of revelation,
this is a question of the probable mode in which the assumed
omnipotent power has acted; and it is not a question of
how we can best honor or magnify that power by believing
that it has acted in one mode and not in another. We
have to take, first, the postulate of an infinitely powerful
Creator, whose existence is an independent inquiry, which
we are to make out upon evidence that satisfies the mind.
The hypothesis of his existence and attributes includes the
power to create species and to establish the process of natural
generation for the continuation of each species, or the
power to make separate creations of each individual, as Mr.
Spencer phrases it, "from hour to hour." In either mode
of action, the power was the same. It is no derogation
from it to suppose that the one or the other mode was
adopted. It is no augmentation of it to suppose that the
one was adopted instead of the other. It is simply a question
of what does the evidence show, to the reasonable satisfaction
of the human mind, to have been most probably
the method that was chosen by a power that could adopt
any method whatever. If we find that the creation of
species and the establishment of the process of natural
generation for the multiplication of individuals is upon the
whole sustained by a predominating weight of evidence, it
is safe to adopt the belief that this hypothesis of the Almighty
method is in accordance with the facts. If the evidence
fails to show that species have arisen from each other
in the same way that individuals have arisen from each
other in natural succession, we have no reason to conclude
that such has been the fact. On the other hand, if the
evidence shows, by reasonably satisfactory proofs, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
process has been established for the evolution of distinct
species out of other and different species, similar to the
process by which individuals arise from each other by natural
generation, it will be safe to conclude that such has
been the fact. Upon either hypothesis, the power of the
Creator remains the same.</p>

<p>Nor is it in any degree necessary to consider in what
sense the one method of action or the other was "miraculous,"
or that the one was an occasional and the other a
perpetual exercise of power. The special creations of individuals
from hour to hour would be just as miraculous as
the special creation of species, and it would be occasional,
although the occasions would be indefinite in number. The
special creation of species would be just as miraculous as
the special creation of individuals, but the occasional exercise
of such a power would be limited by the number of
species, each of which would be a finality in itself. The
dilemma that is suggested by Mr. Spencer is a dilemma
only for those who think it necessary to mingle the idea of
honoring or dishonoring the Creator by one or another
mode of interpreting his works, with a question of his
probable method of action. His method of action is to be
judged upon the evidence which a study of his works discloses.</p>

<p>6. Mr. Spencer, in summing up his objections to the
doctrine of special creations, has said that it not only "fails
to satisfy men's intellectual need of an interpretation," but
that it also "fails to satisfy their moral sentiment"; that
"their moral sentiment is much better satisfied by the doctrine
of evolution, since that doctrine raises no contradictory
implications respecting the Unknown Cause, such as
are raised by the antagonist doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> I have already suggested
what seems to me a sufficient answer to the supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
contradictory implications respecting the goodness and
power of the Almighty Creator. But it is here worthy of
the further inquiry, What has been the influence upon the
sacredness of human life, in human estimation, of a belief
in any other theory of man's origin, or of no belief on the
subject, compared with the effect of a belief in the doctrine
that he is a creature of an Almighty Creator, formed by an
exercise of infinite power for the enjoyment of greater happiness
on earth than any other creature, and therefore having
a peculiarly sacred individual right to the life that has
been given to him? This, to be sure, does not afford a
direct test of the probable truth of the hypothesis respecting
his origin. But the answer to this inquiry will afford
some test of the claim upon our consideration that may be
put forward for any other hypothesis than the one that embraces
the full idea of man's special creation, even if we do
not look beyond this world. Compare, then, the civilization
of the Romans at the period when it was at its highest
development (the age of Julius and Augustus Cæsar), when
in many respects it was a splendid civilization. Neither
among the vulgar, nor among the most cultivated; not
among the most accomplished of the statesmen or philosophers,
was there any such belief as the simple belief in the
relation between Creator and creature, such as had been
held by a people who were regarded by the Romans as barbarians,
in respect to man and all the other animals; or
such a belief as is now held by the least educated peasant
of modern Europe. One consequence of the absence of this
belief, or of the want of a vivid perception of it, was that
the highest persons in the Roman state, men possessed of
all the culture and refinement of their age, not only furnished
for the popular amusement combats of wild beasts of
the most ferocious natures, but they provided gladiatorial
shows in which human beings, trained for the purpose, were
by each other "butchered to make a Roman holiday." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
statesmen who thus catered to the popular tastes, and never
thought of correcting them, subjected themselves to enormous
expenses for the purpose; and all that was noble and
dignified and cultured of both sexes, as well as the rabble,
looked on with delight at the horrid spectacle. But this
was not all. The Roman law, in many ways a code of admirable
ethics, in utter disregard of the natural rights of
men, left the life of the slave within the absolute power of
the master, without any mitigation of the existing law of
nations which made slaves of the captive in war and his
posterity. Compare all this with the civilization of any
modern country in which the life or liberty of man can be
taken away only by judicial process and public authority,
for actual crime; in which institutions exist for the relief
of human suffering and for the prevention of cruelty to the
inferior creatures; and then say whether the belief in special
creations is not a doctrine that has worked vast good
in the world, and one that should not be scouted because
it is a "primitive belief."</p>

<p>Again, compare the ages in modern Europe when statesmen
and politicians of the highest standing with entire
impunity employed assassination for political ends, with
periods in the same countries when assassination had come
to be regarded not only with abhorrence, but as incapable
of justification for any end whatever, public or private, and
then say whether the world can lose its belief that man is
a special creation of God, without losing one of the strongest
safeguards of human life that can be derived from any
belief on the subject. All these, and a great many similar
considerations, while they do not prove the hypothesis of
special creation, show strongly that, unlike some of the
family of beliefs with which it was associated in the darkest
ages, this one has worked no mischiefs; that, on the contrary,
it has been producing moral, social, and political
benefits in all the ages in which it has been most vividly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
present to the popular faith. The command, "Thou shalt
do no murder," from whatever source it came, whether it
was delivered to Moses on the mount of fire, or came from
the teachings of Nature and the dictates of social expediency,
whether it is a divine or a human law, or both, has
unhappily been broken in all times, in all lands, and in
all conditions of civilization. It is broken still. But it
has never yet ceased, for its moral foundation and for the
moral sanction of all the methods which have aimed to enforce
it, to rest on the belief that man is peculiarly the
child of God, whose life is sacred beyond the life of all
other creatures. Whether any other belief of man's origin
will afford an equally good foundation for that law, is a
question which modern scientific speculation may or may
not be able to answer. If its speculations conduct to the
conclusion that the "unknown cause" has not specially
caused anything, has not established any relation of Creator
and creature, that is sufficiently special to imply divine
care for the creature, we know what the answer must be.
The theologian is not the only person who has occasion to
examine the doctrine of evolution; it must be examined by
the statesman as well.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="intro">The doctrine of evolution according to Herbert Spencer further considered.</p>


<p>In the last preceding chapter, I have examined Mr.
Spencer's chief objection to the doctrine of special creations
when considered in its general aspects. I now advance to
the general aspects of the evolution hypothesis as applied
by this philosopher to the animal kingdom. I have already
suggested the appropriate answer to the claim that the
derivation of the evolution hypothesis is favorable because
it has originated "among the most instructed class and in
these better-instructed times," and that the derivation of
the other hypothesis is unfavorable because "it originated
in times of profound ignorance." On this point it is unnecessary
to say more. But there is a supposed "kindred
antithesis" between "the two families of beliefs" to which
these two hypotheses are said respectively to belong; one of
which families "has been dying out," while the other
family "has been multiplying." This brings into view the
peculiar philosophical system of Mr. Spencer, by which he
maintains "the unity of Nature," or the prevalence of a
universal law of evolution, as the law which is to be discerned
in remote fields of inquiry, and which "will presently be
recognized as the law of the phenomena which we are here
considering," namely, the phenomena of animal life.
"The discovery that evolution has gone on, and is going
on, in so many departments of Nature, becomes a reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
for believing that there is no department of Nature in which
it does not go on."<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>In considering this mode of generalization it is important
to distinguish between the phenomena that are observable
in those departments of Nature which include only
dead or inanimate matter, and the phenomena that are
peculiar to matter organized into living beings. Again: it
is important to distinguish between phenomena which have
been influenced by human agencies and those which can
not have been affected by the power of man. Another distinction
of the greatest consequence is that which divides
the phenomena in question according to their relation to a
moral purpose. In one class of phenomena, a moral purpose
may be plainly discovered as the purpose of an intelligent
causing power, which has chosen a particular means
for the accomplishment of an end. In another class of
phenomena, a moral purpose may not be discoverable as
the end for which the existing arrangement of things was
specially designed, and to which that arrangement was an
indispensable means. By classifying the departments of
Nature and observing their phenomena with these discriminations,
we shall be able to judge of the value of Mr.
Spencer's philosophical system when applied to the animal
kingdom.</p>

<p>In grouping the departments and their respective phenomena
as departments in which the law of evolution has
obtained, and in drawing from them the sweeping deduction
that there is no department in which this law has not obtained
as the <i lang="la">causa causans</i>, Mr. Spencer does not appear
to have made these necessary discriminations. He specifies
the following remote fields of inquiry, in which he maintains
that this law of evolution is now admitted to be the
solution of the phenomena that lie in those respective fields:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
First, the solar system, which, as he asserts, astronomers
now consider has been gradually evolved out of diffused
matter.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Second, geological discoveries, which show that
the earth has reached its present varied structure through
a process of evolution. Third, society, which has progressed
through a corresponding process of gradual development.
"Constitutions are not made, but grow," is said to
be now a recognized truth among "philosophical politicians,"
and a part of the more general truth that "societies
are not made, but grow." Fourth, languages, which, we
are told, are now believed not to have been artificially or
supernaturally formed, but to have been developed. Finally,
the histories of religions, philosophy, science, the fine
arts, and the industrial arts, show, it is said, development
"through as unobtrusive changes as those which the mind
of a child passes on its way to maturity."<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that in some of these departments neither
human agency nor the human will and choice can have had
any influence in producing the phenomena, while in some
of them human agency, will, and choice have had a vast
influence in making the phenomena what they are. That
political constitutions or social institutions are not made,
but grow, is a dogma that is by no means universally true,
however wise it may sound, or with whatever confidence in
a paradox it may be asserted by "some political philosophers."
While past events and present exigencies may
have largely shaped some political constitutions, we know
that others have been deliberately modified by a choice that
has had more or less of a free scope, and that sometimes this
has amounted to an arbitrary decision. Languages may or
may not have been a direct and supernatural gift from Heaven,
but we know that their structure has been powerfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
influenced by human agencies, when they have come to be
written expressions of thought; for they have then received
expansion by the actual coinage of new words, as well as by
new meanings of old words; and even when they were in the
first stages of a spoken tongue, inflections that were purely
arbitrary have been introduced. So it has been with systems
of religion, philosophy, the fine arts, the mechanic arts,
legislation, and jurisprudence. While in all these departments
changes have been going on, which upon a superficial
view appear to indicate a kind of spontaneous development,
when they are analyzed they are seen to have been
wholly caused, or more or less influenced, by the genius,
the thought, the discoveries, the exertions, and the acts of
particular individuals who have had the force to impress
themselves upon the age, and thus to make new systems,
new beliefs, new products, new rules of social or political
life, new tastes, and new habits of thinking and acting.</p>

<p>Again: in some of the various orders of phenomena
which are found in these different departments, there is
discernible a distinct moral purpose in the shape which
they have been made to assume, and in others of them
there is no moral purpose discoverable, which we can say
required the employment of the particular means to effect
the end. Thus, astronomers can not assign a moral purpose
for which the distribution of the fixed stars was made
to be what it is, and which purpose could not have been
answered by some other arrangement. At the same time,
it is easy to see that the solar system was arranged with reference
to the law of universal gravitation, which made this
arrangement of the different bodies essential to the harmonious
working of a great and complex piece of mechanism.
The present formation of the earth may have resulted just
as geologists think it has, and yet they can not say that
there was no moral purpose in the division of the exterior
surface of our globe into land and water, seas, continents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
mountains, etc. These are departments of Nature in which
man has had no influence in producing the phenomena.
When we turn to those departments in which man is placed
as an actor, we often find an adjustment of means to an
end that is so comprehensive, as well as so plain, that we
may justly conclude it to have been chosen by the creating
power, with the express intent that human agency should
be the means by which certain effects are to be produced.
For example: man is eminently a social animal. Human
society is a result of his strong social propensities. He is
placed in it as an actor; and in this arrangement there is
discoverable a moral purpose so plain that we may rightfully
regard the social phenomena of mutual protection
and improvement as proofs that society was ordained as the
sphere of man's highest development on earth.</p>

<p>So that, in reasoning about the phenomena of any of the
departments of Nature as affording indications of the so-called
universal law of evolution, we must not forget the
distinction between organized inanimate and organized animated
matter; or the distinction between those departments
in which human will or choice, or the human intellect,
has had no influence in shaping the phenomena, and
those in which they have had great influence; or the distinction
between phenomena in which a special moral purpose
can be and those in which it can not be discovered, as
the reason for the existing order of things. It is especially
hazardous to argue that because a spontaneous development,
or a gradual evolution, can be traced in some of the
phenomena of inanimate matter, it therefore must obtain
in the animal kingdom. It is alike hazardous to argue,
because there has been what is called evolution in some
departments of Nature over which man has had no control,
that the same law obtains in other departments over which
he has also had no control, or those in which he has had a
large control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>The bearing of these discriminations upon the supposed
universality of the law of evolution may now be seen if we
attend to the further inquiry whether that law obtains
throughout all the phenomena of any one department of
Nature as the sole cause of the phenomena in that department.
Take again, for example, the solar system. Suppose
it to be true that the bodies which compose it, the sun
and the planetary spheres, were gradually evolved out of
diffused matter. Does it necessarily follow that their existing
arrangements and mutual relations were not specially
designed? That their orbits, their revolutions, their distances
from each other, were not specially planned? That
they were not hung in their respective positions with an
intentional adjustment to the great force of gravitation
that was prevailing throughout the universe? Must we
suppose that all this part of the whole phenomena of the
solar system resulted from the operation of an ungoverned
evolution, because the bodies themselves may have been
gradually formed out of diffused matter into their present
condition without being spoken at once into that condition
by the fiat of the Almighty? We can certainly see that
the existing arrangements must have been intentional; and,
if intentional, the intention must have taken effect in the
production of the phenomena exhibited by the arrangement,
as any design takes effect in the production of the
phenomena which are open to our observation. The moral
purpose evinced by one part of this arrangement, the alternation
of day and night upon the earth, for example, might
have been effected by some other means than the means
which now produce it. But there is the strongest evidence
that a certain means was chosen and intentionally put into
operation; and although we can not tell why that means
was preferred, the fact that it was both designed and preferred
makes it a special creation. To suppose that it was
left to be worked out by a process such as the hypothesis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of evolution assumes, by the gradual, fortuitous, and ungoverned
operation of infinitely slow-moving causes, which
might have made the adjustments very different from what
they are, is to deprive it of the element of intentional
preference that is proved by its existence. The hypothesis
of evolution, when applied to all the phenomena of the
solar system, relegates one great branch of those phenomena
to a realm from which all special purposes and all direct
design are absent, and confines the explanation of the phenomena
to the operation of causes that might have brought
about very different arrangements. That this supposed
process of evolution has, in fact, been followed by the existing
arrangements of the solar system, does not prove, or
tend to prove, that the existing arrangements are solely
due to the supposed method of their production; for we
can not leave out the element of some design, and if there
was a design, the very nature of the system required that
the design should be executed by a special creation of a
plan for the mutual relations of the bodies composing it.
The bodies themselves might have been gradually formed
out of diffused matter, floating loosely in the realms of
space. The relations of the bodies to each other required
the act of an intelligent will, in the direct formation of an
intentional plan; and that act was an act of special creation
in the same sense in which the structural plan of a
species of animal was a special creation.</p>

<p>Here, then, is one department of Nature in which it is
not necessary and not philosophical to assume that the law
of so-called evolution has been the universal law to which
all the phenomena of that department are to be attributed.
If we follow out the same inquiry in other departments of
Nature remote from the animal kingdom, we shall find
reason to adopt the same conclusion in respect to their
phenomena. Thus, let us for a moment contemplate another
of the departments in which inanimate matter is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
subject of observation, and in which human will or intelligence
has had no agency in producing the phenomena,
namely, the formation of the present structure of the
earth as it is described by geologists. This is a department
in which the hypothesis of evolution finds perhaps
its stronghold. Yet it is necessary even here to recognize
an intentional plan and direct design in some part of the
phenomena. Let us suppose that during the period required
by any of the speculations of geologists, however
long, a mass of matter was gathered in an unformed condition,
and gradually shaped into the present condition of
the earth by the action of its constituent elements upon
each other, influenced by the laws of mechanical forces, of
chemical combinations, of light and heat, and of whatever
physical agencies were made to operate in the process of
evolving the mass into the condition in which it has been
known to us for a certain time. Is it a rational conclusion
that the intelligent power which put these forces in operation&mdash;an
hypothesis with which we must begin to reason,
or leave the origin of both matter and forces to blind
chance&mdash;did not guide their operation at all to the intentional
production of the results which we see? The results
disclose some manifest purposes; and although these purposes,
or others equally beneficent, might have been accomplished
by different arrangements, we can see that
they have been effected by a certain arrangement of a
specific character. The results have been continents, seas,
mountains, rivers, lakes, formation and distribution of
minerals, growth of forests, and an almost innumerable,
and certainly a very varied, catalogue of phenomena, physical
formations, and adaptations. All these varied results
disclose a plan by which this earth became a marvelously
convenient abode for the living creatures that have inhabited
or still inhabit it, especially for man. The formation
of this plan was an intelligent act, if we suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
any intelligent being projected the original gathering of
the crude primordial matter and subjected it to the operation
of the forces employed to shape it into its present condition.
This plan was an act of special creation, in the
same sense in which the plan of a particular animal organism
may have been a special creation. While, therefore, a
process which may be called evolution may have operated
as the agency through which the earth has reached its
present physical condition, the plan of that condition was
certainly not formed by any such process; for it was, if it
was the product of anything, the product of an intelligent
will operating in the production of preconceived results by
the exercise of superhuman and infinite wisdom and foresight.</p>

<p>When we turn to a department in which human influence
has largely or wholly shaped the phenomena, we find
numerous special creations that are not attributable to the
operation of any law of development or evolution such as is
supposed to have led to the production of one species of
animal out of another, or out of several previous species.
In short, a survey of all the departments of Nature leads to
the conclusion that while there may be phenomena which
are properly traceable to the operation of the forces of
Nature, or to fixed general systems of production, there is
another very large class of the phenomena which owe their
existence to special acts of an intelligent will, finite or
infinite, human or divine, according as their production
required superhuman power or admitted of the efficacy of
man's intervention.</p>

<p>The way is now somewhat cleared for an examination
of Mr. Spencer's application of the law of evolution to the
gradual formation of different species of animals out of one
or more previous species, without any act of special creation
intervening anywhere in the series. We have seen that this
alleged law is not of universal force as the cause of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
phenomena in all the departments of Nature. When we
come to apply it as the hypothesis which is to account for
the existence of different species of animals of very different
types, we must remember that we are dealing with organisms
endowed with life, and, although we can not sufficiently
explain what life is, we know that animated organisms
are brought into being by systems of production that
are widely different from the modes in which inanimate
matter may have been or has been made to assume its existing
forms. Bearing this in mind, we come to the arguments
and proofs by which Mr. Spencer maintains the immense
superiority of the evolution hypothesis over that of
special creations, in reference to the animal kingdom. It
must be remembered that this is a department in which
man can have had no agency in producing the phenomena,
for whatever may have been the slight variations produced
by human interference with the breeding of animals domesticated
from their wild condition, we must investigate the
origin of species as if there had never been any human intervention
in the crossing of breeds, because that origin is
to be looked for in a sphere entirely removed from all
human interference. Man himself is included in the investigation,
and we must make that investigation in reference
to a time when he did not exist, or when he did not
exist as we now know him.</p>

<p>One of the favorite methods of Mr. Spencer consists in
arraying difficulties for the believers in special creations,
which, he argues, can not be encountered by their hypothesis,
and then arguing that there are no difficulties in the
way of the hypothesis of evolution. His position shall be
stated with all the strength that he gives to it, and with
all the care that I can bestow upon its treatment. He puts
the argument thus: In the animal kingdom individuals
come into being by a process of generation&mdash;that is to say,
they arise out of other individuals of the same species. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
we contemplate the individuals of any species, we find an
evolution repeated in every one of them by a uniform process
of development, which, in a short space of time, produces
a series of astonishing changes. The seed becomes a
tree, and the tree differs from the seed immeasurably in
bulk, structure, color, form, specific gravity, and chemical
composition; so that no visible resemblance can be pointed
out between them. The small, semi-transparent gelatinous
spherule constituting the human ovum becomes the newly-born
child; and this human infant "is so complex in its
structure that a cyclopædia is needed to describe its constituent
parts. The germinal vesicle is so simple that it
may be defined in a line. Nevertheless, a few months suffice
to develop the one out of the other, and that, too, by
a series of modifications so small that were the embryo
examined, at successive minutes, even a microscope would
with difficulty disclose any sensible changes. Aided by
such facts, the conception of general evolution may be rendered
as definite a conception as any of our complex conceptions
can be rendered. If, instead of the successive
minutes of a child's fœtal life, we take successive generations
of creatures, if we regard the successive generations
as differing from each other no more than the fœtus did
in successive minutes, our imaginations must indeed be
feeble if we fail to realize in thought the evolution of the
most complex organism out of the simplest. If a single
cell, under appropriate conditions, becomes a man in the
space of a few years, there can surely be no difficulty in
understanding how, under appropriate conditions, a cell
may, in the course of untold millions of years, give origin
to the human race."<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have a comparison between what takes
place in the development of the individual animal in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
space of a few years, and what may be supposed to take place
in the successive generations of different creatures through
untold millions of years. We turn then to the proof, direct
or indirect, that races of entirely distinct organisms have
resulted from antecedent races by gradual transformation.
Direct proof sufficient to establish the progressive modifications
of antecedent races into other races is not claimed to
exist; yet it is claimed that there are numerous facts of the
order required by the hypothesis which warrant our acceptance
of it. These facts are the alterations of structure
which take place in successive generations of the same
species, amounting, in the course of several generations of
the same race, to additions and suppressions of parts. These
changes among the individuals of the same race, comprehended
in what is scientifically called "heredity" and
"variation," are exhibited by the transmission of ancestral
peculiarities of structure, by their occasional suppression
in some individuals of the race and their reappearance in
others, and by a difference in the relative sizes of parts.
These variations, arising in successive short intervals of
time, are said to be quite as marked as those which arise
in a developing embryo, and, in fact, they are said to be
often much more marked. "The structural modifications
proved to have taken place since organisms have been observed
is not less than the hypothesis demands&mdash;bears as
great a ratio to this brief period as the total amount of
structural change seen in the evolution of a complex organism
out of a simple germ bears to the vast period during
which living forms have existed on earth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The difficulty that is thus prepared for the hypothesis
of the special creation of species may now be stated. There
is a professed conception of the ultimate power which is
manifested to us through phenomena. That conception implies
omnipotence and omniscience, and it therefore implies
regularity of method, because uniformity of method is a
mark of strength, whereas irregularity of method is a mark
of weakness. "A persistent process, adapted to all contingencies,
implies greater skill in the achievement of an end
than its achievement by the process of meeting the contingencies
as they severally arise." And, therefore, those who
adopt the notion of the special creation of species do, it is
said, in truth impair the professed character of the power
to which they assume that the phenomena of the existence
of species are to be referred, whereas the hypothesis of the
evolution of species out of other species is much more consistent
with the professed conception of the ultimate power.</p>

<p>In this claim of superiority for the evolution hypothesis,
the learned philosopher seems to have been almost oblivious
of the fact that he was dealing with animal organisms in two
aspects: first, in regard to the method by which individuals
of the same species come into existence; and, second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>ly,
in regard to the method by which different species have
come into existence. In the first case, regularity of method
is evinced by the establishment of a uniform process of
procreation and gestation. This process, while retaining
throughout the different classes of animals one fundamental
and characteristic method, namely, the union of
the sexes, is widely varied in respect to the time of gestation,
the fœtal development, and the nourishment of the
young before and after birth. There is no difficulty whatever
in discovering the great reason for which this system
of the reproduction of individuals was established. The
tie that it makes between parents and offspring, and more
especially the tie between the female parent and the offspring,
was obviously one grand end for which this system
of giving existence to individuals was adopted; and although
the instinct which arises out of it is in some species
feeble and almost inactive, it rises higher and higher in its
power and its manifestations in proportion as the animals
rise in the scale of being, until in man it exhibits its greatest
force and its most various effects, producing at last pride
of ancestry, and affecting in various ways the social and
even the political condition of mankind. But how can
any corresponding connection between one race of animals
and another, or between antecedent and subsequent species,
be imagined? The sexual impulse implanted in animals
leads to the production of offspring of the same race. The
desire for offspring keeps up the perpetual succession of
individuals, and love of the offspring insures the protection
of the newly born by the most powerful of impulses. But
what can be imagined as an analogous impulse, appetite, or
propensity which should lead one species to strive after the
production of another species? Is it said that the different
species are evolved out of one another by a process in which
the conscious desires, the efforts, the aspirations of the preceding
races play no part? This is certainly true, if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
was ever any such process as the evolution of species out of
species; and it follows that, in respect to one great moral
purpose of a process, there is no analogy to be derived from
the regularity and uniformity of the process by which individuals
of the same species are multiplied. Moreover, in
regard to the latter process, we know that a barrier has
been set to its operation; for Nature does not now admit
of the sexual union between animals of entirely distinct
species, and we have no reason to believe that it ever did
admit of it at any period in the geological history of the
earth.</p>

<p>Still further: In what sense are special creations "irregularities
of method"? In what sense are they "contingencies"?
And if they are "contingencies," how does
it imply less skill to suppose that they have been met as
they have severally arisen, than would be implied by supposing
that they have been achieved by a uniform process
adapted to all contingencies? This notion that something
is derogated from the idea of omnipotence and omniscience
by the hypothesis that such a power has acted by special
exercises of its creating faculty in the production of different
orders of beings as completed and final types, instead
of allowing or causing them to be successively evolved out
of each other by gradual derivations, is neither logical nor
philosophical. In no proper sense is a method of action an
irregular method unless it was imposed upon the actor by
some antecedent necessity, which compelled him to apply
a method which was made uniform in one case to another
case in which the same kind of uniformity would not be
indispensable. The uniformity of the process by which individuals
of the same species are multiplied is a uniformity
for that particular end. The regularity in that case is a
regularity that has its special objects to accomplish. The
uniformity and regularity of a different method of causing
different types of organisms to exist, so long as the object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
is always effected in the same way, is just as truly a regularity
and uniformity for that case, and just as completely
fulfills the idea of infinite skill. That such creations are
specially made, that they are independently made, and that
each is made for a distinct purpose and also for the complex
purposes of a varied class of organisms, does not render
them contingencies arising at random, or make the
method of meeting them an occasional, irregular, spasmodic
device for encountering something unforeseen and
unexpected. The very purposes for which the distinct organisms
exist&mdash;purposes that are apparent on a comprehensive
survey of their various structures and modes of life&mdash;and
the fact that they have come into existence by some
process that was for the production of the ends a uniform
and regular one, whether that process was special creation
or evolution, render the two methods of action equally consistent
with the professed conception of the ultimate power.
On the hypothesis of special creations so many different
types of organism as the Creator has seen fit to create have
been made by the exercise of a power remaining uniformly
of the same infinite nature, but varying the products at
will for the purposes of infinite wisdom.</p>

<p>What, again, does the learned author mean by meeting
"contingencies" "as they have severally arisen"? This
suggestion of a difficulty for the believers in special creations
seems to imply that the distinct types of animal organisms
arose somehow as necessities outside of the divine
will, and that the Almighty artificer had to devise occasional
methods of meeting successive demands which he
did not create. The hypothesis of special creations does
not drive its believers into any such implications. The
several distinct types of animal organisms are supposed to
have arisen in the divine mind as types which the Almighty
saw fit to create for certain purposes, and to have been severally
fashioned as types by his infinite power. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
in no sense "contingencies" which he had to meet as occasions
arising outside of his infinite will. A human artificer
has conceived and executed upon a novel plan a machine
that is distinguishable from all other machines. He
did not create the demand for that machine; the demand
has grown out of the wants of society; and the artificer
has met the demand by his genius and his mechanical
skill, which have effected a marked improvement in the
condition of society. In one sense, therefore, he has met a
"contingency," because he has met a demand. But the
infinite Creator, upon the hypothesis of his existence and
attributes, does not meet an external demand; there is no
demand upon him; he creates the occasion; he makes the
different organisms to effectuate the infinite purposes which
he also creates; the want and the means of satisfying the
want alike arise in the infinite wisdom and will. Such is
the hypothesis. We may now, therefore, pursue in some
further detail the argument which maintains that this hypothesis
is of far inferior strength to that of evolution, as
the method in which the Almighty power has acted in the
production of different animal organisms.</p>

<p>First we have the analogy that is supposed to be afforded
by what takes place in the development of a single cell
into a man in the space of a few years, and an alleged correspondence
of development by which a single cell, in the
course of untold millions of years, has given origin to the
human race. Granting any difference of time which this
comparison calls for, and substituting in place of the successive
moments or years of an individual life, from the
formation of the ovum to the fully developed animal, the
successive generations of any imaginable series of animals,
the question is not merely what we can definitely conceive,
or how successfully we can construct a theory. It is
whether the supposed analogy will hold; whether we can
find that in the two cases development takes place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
same way or in a way that is so nearly alike in the two cases
as to warrant us in reasoning from the one to the other.
In the case of the development of the single cell into the
mature animal, although we can not, either before or after
birth, detect the changes that are taking place from minute
to minute, the infinitesimal accretions or losses, we know
that there is a perpetual and unbroken connection of life
maintained from the moment when the fœtus is formed to
the moment when the mature animal stands before us.
Break this connection anywhere in the process of development,
and life is destroyed; the development is at once arrested.
It is this connection that constitutes, as I presume,
what the learned author calls the "appropriate conditions,"
in the case of the production of the individual animal; it
is, at all events, the one grand and indispensable condition
to the development of the cell into the fœtus, of the fœtus
into the newly born child, and of the child into the man.
Now, if we are to reason from this case of individual development
to the other case of successive generations of creatures
differing from each other in the same or any other
ratio in which the perfect man differs from the ovum, the
fœtus, or the newly born child, which are all successive
stages of one and the same individual life, we ought to find
in the successive generations of the different creatures some
bond of connection, some continuity of lives with lives,
some perpetuation from one organism to another, that will
constitute the "appropriate conditions" for a corresponding
development from a single cell through the successive
types of animal life into the human race. Without such
connection, continuity, perpetuation from organism to organism,
shown by some satisfactory proof, we have nothing
but a theory, and a theory that is destitute of the grand
conditions that will alone support the analogy between the
two cases. If anywhere in the supposed chain of successive
generations of different animals the continuity of animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and animal is broken, the hypothesis of special creations of
new organisms must come in: for we must remember that
we are reasoning about animal life, and if the continuity of
lives with one another is interrupted, the series terminates,
just as the series between the ovum, the fœtus, the child,
and the man terminates, at whatever stage it is interrupted
by a cause that destroys the mysterious principle of life.
It is therefore absolutely necessary to look for some proof
which will show that in the supposed series of successive
generations of animals out of antecedent types, by whatever
gradations and in whatever space of time we may suppose
the process of evolution to have been worked, there
has been a continuity of life between the different types, a
perpetuation of organism from organism, a connection of
lives with lives.</p>

<p>We now come to another supposed analogy, on which
great stress is laid by the evolution school, and especially
by Mr. Spencer. Individuals of the same family are found
to be marked by striking peculiarities of structure, ancestral
traits, which appear and disappear and then appear
again, in successive generations. This is obviously a case
where the "appropriate conditions" are all comprehended
in the connection of life with life. When we trace the
pedigree of a single man or any other individual animal
back to a remote pair of ancestors, we connect together in
an unbroken chain the successive generations of parents
and offspring. If the chain is anywhere broken, so that
direct descent can not be traced throughout the series, we
can not by direct evidence carry the peculiarities of family
traits any further back than the ancestor or pair of ancestors
with which we can find an unbroken connection of life
with life. We do indeed often say in common parlance
that an individual must have a trace of a certain blood in
his veins, because of certain peculiarities of structure, complexion,
or other tokens of descent, even when we can not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
find a perfect pedigree which would show where the infusion
of the supposed blood came in. But although it might
be allowable, in making out the descent of an individual
man or any other animal, from a certain ancestor or pair of
ancestors, to aid the pedigree by strong family or race resemblance,
even when a link is wanting, it could only be
for the purpose of establishing a pedigree, a connection of
lives with lives, that such collateral evidence could be resorted
to. If by direct proof of an unbroken descent a full
pedigree is made out, or if, when some link is wanting, the
collateral proof from strong family or race resemblances is
sufficient to warrant the belief that the link once existed,
we might accept it as a fact that the individual descended
from the supposed ancestors in a direct line, or that some
peculiarity of blood came into his constitution at some
point in the descent of individuals from individuals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Can we apply this mode of reasoning to the evolution
of distinct types of animals out of antecedent and different
types? The very nature of the descent or derivation that
is to be satisfactorily established requires a connection of
lives with lives, just as such a connection is required in
making out the pedigree of an individual animal. We
must construct a pedigree for the different classes or types
of animals through which, by direct or collateral evidence,
we can connect the different organisms together, so as to
warrant the belief that by the ordinary process of generation
these animals of widely different organizations have
been successfully developed out of each other, life from
life, organisms from organisms. The hypothesis is, that
from a single cell all the various races and types of animals
have in process of time been gradually formed out of each
other, through an ascending scale, until we reach the human
race, whose race pedigree consists of a series of imperceptible
formations, back to the single cell from which the whole
series proceeded. This, we must remember, is not a case
of the evolving production of different forms of inanimate
matter, but it is the case of the evolving production of different
forms of animal life out of other preceding and different
forms, by the process of animal generation.</p>

<p>Of direct evidence of this evolution of species, it can
not be said that we have any which will make it a parallel
case with the direct evidence of the descent of an individual
from parents and other ancestors. We have different animal
organisms that are marked by distinctions which com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>pel
us to regard them as separate species, and there is no
known instance in which we can directly trace a production
of one of these distinct species out of another or others by
finding a connection of lives with lives. Even in the vegetable
kingdom, with all the crosses for which Nature has
made such wonderful and various provision, we do not find
such occurrences as the production of an oak out of the
seed of an apple, or the production of an orange-tree out of
an acorn. We do not gather grapes of thorns or figs of
thistles. There are barriers set to miscegenation even in
the vegetable world, and we have no direct evidence that at
any period in the geological history of the earth these barriers
have been crossed, and very little indirect evidence to
warrant us in believing that they ever have been or ever
will be. In the animal kingdom such barriers are extremely
prominent and certain. We not only have no direct
evidence that any one species of animal was at any period
of the earth's history or in any length of time gradually
evolved out of another distinct species, but we know that
the union of the sexes and the production of new individuals
can not take place out of certain limits; that, while
Nature will permit of the crossing of different breeds of the
same animal, and so will admit of very limited variations of
structure, she will not admit of the sexual union of different
species, so as to produce individuals having a union of
the different organisms, or a resultant of a third organism
of a different type from any that had preceded it. Is it,
for example, from mere taste or moral feeling that such
occurrences as the sexual union between man and beast
have not been known to have produced a third and different
animal? We know that it is because the Almighty has
"fixed his canon" against such a union in the case of man
and in the cases of all the other distinct animal organisms;
and to find this canon we do not need to go to Scripture or
revelation, although we may find it there also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>We are remitted, therefore, to indirect evidence, and in
considering this evidence we have to note that we have
nothing but an imaginary pedigree, or one hypothetically
constructed, to which to apply it. In tracing the pedigree
of an individual animal, we have a certain number of
known connections of life with life; and where it becomes
necessary to bridge over a break in the connection so as to
carry the line back to an earlier ancestor, we may perhaps
apply the collateral evidence of family or race resemblance
to assist in making the connection with that particular
ancestor a reasonably safe deduction. But in the case of
the hypothetical pedigree which supposes the human race
to have been evolved from a single cell through successive
organisms rising higher and higher in the scale of being,
we have no known connections of lives with lives to which
to apply the collateral proofs. The collateral proofs are
not auxiliary evidence; they are the sole evidence; and
unless they are such as to exclude every other reasonable
explanation of the phenomena which they exhibit excepting
that of the supposed evolution, they can not be said to
satisfy the rules of rational belief in the hypothesis to
which we apply them.</p>

<p>What, then, is the indirect and collateral evidence? It
consists, as we have already seen, of two principal classes
of phenomena: first, resemblances of fœtal development
which are found on comparing the fœtal growth of different
species of animals; second, resemblances in the structure
of different species of animals after birth and maturity.
These various resemblances are supposed to constitute proof
of descent from a common stock, which may be carried
back in the series as far as the resemblance can be carried,
at whatever point that may be. Thus, in comparing all the
vertebrata, we find certain marked peculiarities of structure
common to the whole class: the deduction is, that all
the vertebrate animals came from a common stock. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
comparing all the mammalia, we find certain marked peculiarities
of structure common to the whole class: the deduction
is that all the mammalia came from a common
stock. Going still further back in the supposed series, we
come to the amphibians, as the supposed common stock
from which the vertebrate and mammalian land animals
were derived; and, comparing the different classes of the
amphibians, we find certain resemblances which point to
the fish inhabitants of the water as their common stock;
and then we trace the more highly organized fishes through
the more lowly organized back to the aquatic worm, which
may itself be supposed to have been developed out of a
single cell.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The resemblances of structure, wherever we make the
comparison between different species, are referable to an
ideal plan of animal construction, followed throughout a
class of animals, and adjusted to their peculiar differences
which distinguish one species from another, just as in the
vegetable world there is an ideal plan of construction of
trees followed throughout a class of plants, and adjusted to
the peculiar differences which distinguish one kind of tree
from another. As between man and the monkey, or between
man and the horse, or the seal, or the bat, or the
bird, there are certain resemblances in the structure of the
skeleton, which indicate an identity of plan, although varied
in its adjustments to the distinguishing structure of
each separate species of animal. In a former chapter, I
have shown why the adoption of an ideal plan of a general
character is consistent with what I have called the "economy
of Nature" in the special creation of different species.
On a careful revision of the subject, I can see no reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
change the expression, or to modify the idea which it was
intended to convey, and which I will here repeat. It is
entirely consistent with the conception of an infinite and
all-wise creating power, to suppose that in the formation
of a large class of organisms, all the constructive power
that was needed for the formation of a general plan was
exercised throughout the class, and that there was super added
the exercise of all the power of variation that was
needful to produce distinct species. Repetition of the same
general plan of construction is certainly no mark of inferiority
of original power, if accompanied by adaptations
to new and further conditions. It is a proof that in one
direction all the necessary power was used, and no more,
and that in producing the distinct organisms the necessary
amount of further power was also used. If we follow the
resemblances of structure that may be traced through all
the animals of a varied class, we shall find that they may
be referred, as a rational and consistent hypothesis, to this
method of giving to each animal its characteristic formation.
If this is a rational hypothesis, it is so because it is
consistent with all the observable phenomena; and consequently,
the opposite hypothesis that all these phenomena
of resemblances and differences are due to the law of evolution
does not exclude every other explanation of their existence.</p>

<p>To apply this now to one of the comparisons on which
great stress is laid&mdash;the comparison between the brain of
man and that of the ape. Two questions arise in this comparison:
1. Do the resemblances necessarily show that
these two animals came from a common stock? 2. Do
the resemblances necessarily show that man was descended
from some ape through intermediate animals by gradual
transformations? And, when I ask whether the comparison
necessarily leads to these conclusions, I mean to ask
whether the resemblances point so strongly to the conclu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>sions
that they must rationally be held to exclude every
other hypothesis.</p>

<p>Prof. Huxley furnished to Mr. Darwin a very learned
note, in which he stated the results of all that is now
known concerning the resemblances and differences in
the structure and the development of the brain in man
and the apes. The differences may be laid aside in the
present discussion, because it is not necessary, for my present
purpose, to found anything upon them. But the resemblances,
just as they are stated by the eminent anatomist,
without regard to controverted details, are the important
facts to be considered. The substance of the
whole comparison is that the cerebral hemispheres in
man and the higher apes are disposed after the very same
pattern in him as in them; that every principal "gyrus"
and "sulcus" of a chimpanzee's brain is clearly represented
in that of a man, so that the terminology which applies to
one answers for the other; that there is no dispute as to
the resemblance in fundamental character between the
ape's brain and man's; and that even the details of the
arrangement of the "gyri" and "sulci" of the cerebral
hemispheres present a wonderfully close similarity between
the chimpanzee, orang, and man.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> These are said to be
the result of a comparison of the adult brain of man and
the higher apes; and, although it is claimed by some anatomists
that there are fundamental differences in the mode
of their development which point to a difference of origin,
this is denied by Huxley, who maintains that there is a
fundamental agreement in the development of the brain in
man and apes. His views of the facts for the purpose of
the present inquiry may be accepted without controversy,
not only because he is an authority whose statements of
facts I am not disposed to dispute, but because it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
not necessary to dispute them. What, then, do they
show?</p>

<p>They show that there are animals known as apes and
animals known as men, whose brains are found to be fundamentally
constructed upon the same general plan, with
strong resemblances throughout the different parts of the
organ; and the first question is, Do these resemblances show
that the two animals came from a common stock? Upon
the theory that man has resulted from the gradual modifications
of the same form as that from which the apes have
sprung, the resemblances in the structure of their respective
brains are claimed as having a tendency to show that there
was an animal which preceded both of them, and which
was their common ancestor, in the same sense in which an
individual progenitor was the common ancestor of two
other individuals, whether one of these two individuals
was or was not descended from the other in a direct line.
On the other hand, upon the hypothesis of the special creation
of the ape as one animal, and the special creation of
man as another animal, there was no common stock from
which the two animals have been derived, and the resemblances
of their brains point to the adoption of a general
plan of construction for that organ, or its construction
upon the same model, and the adaptation of that model to
the other parts of the structure, and the purposes of the
existence of each of the two animals. Without again repeating
the argument which shows that the latter hypothesis
is perfectly consistent with the professed conception of
the infinite power, I will now inquire whether, on the
former hypothesis, we have anything to which we can apply
the evidence of resemblance as a collateral aid in reaching
the conclusion that these two animals were derived
from a common progenitor, or from some antecedent animal
whose brain and other parts of the structure became
modified into theirs by numerous intermediate gradations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the higher apes, or between any of the apes and
any known antecedent and different animal, no naturalist
has discovered the intermediate link or links. Darwin supposes
that there was some one extremely ancient progenitor
from which proceeded the two main divisions of the <i lang="la">Simiadæ</i>&mdash;namely,
the Catarrhine and Platyrhine monkeys, with
their sub-groups. This extremely ancient progenitor is nothing
but a scientific hypothesis; or, to use a legal phrase, it
had nothing but a constructive existence. It is necessary to
believe in the principle of evolution, in order to work out
the hypothesis of this creature from which the two great
stems of the <em>Simiadæ</em> are supposed to have proceeded. Here,
then, we have the case of a pedigree or succession of animal
races, the <i lang="la">propositum</i> of which has no known existence.
Next we have two known divisions of the <i lang="la">Simiadæ</i>, or
monkeys; but, between them and their imaginary common
progenitor, we have no known intermediate animals constituting
the gradations of structure from the progenitor to
the descendants. The whole chain has to be made out by
tracing resemblances among the animals of a certain class
that are known, then applying these resemblances to the
supposed divergencies from the structure of a supposed
progenitor, and then drawing the conclusion that there
was such a progenitor. It may be submitted to the
common sense of mankind, whether this is a state of facts
which will warrant scientists or philosophers in using toward
those who do not accept their theory quite so much of
the <i lang="fr">de haut en bas</i> style of remark as we find in the writings
of Mr. Spencer.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> If the researches of geologists had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
discovered any remains of an animal that would fulfill the
requirements, and thus stand as the progenitor of the
<em>Simiadæ</em>. By the case would correspond to that of a known individual
from whom we undertake to trace the descent of
another individual through many intermediates; and in
such a case strong family resemblances of various kinds
might possibly afford some aid in making out the pedigree
as a reliable conclusion. But there is no means of connecting
the Old World and the New World apes with any but
an unknown and imaginary, progenitor. Darwin himself
frankly tells us that "the early progenitor of the whole
Simian stock, including man," is an undiscovered animal,
which may not have been identical with, or may not even
have closely resembled, any existing ape or monkey.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Passing from the supposed common progenitor to the
resemblances between the brain of the higher apes and the
brain of man, we come to the question whether these resemblances
show that man was descended from any of the
Simian stock through intermediate animals by gradual
transformation. Here the case is in one respect different;
for the animals that are to be compared are known, and
their respective brains have been subjected to close anatomical
scrutiny. This part of the process of evolution begins
from one true species, the ape, and ends in another true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
species, the man. We are unable to trace the man and the
ape to a common progenitor race; but we find the ape possessed
of a brain which strongly resembles man's. I have
searched diligently in the writings of naturalists for a sound
reason which ought rationally to exclude the hypothesis
that the brain of the ape was formed upon the same ideal
plan as the brain of man, each animal being a distinct species
and separately created. Anatomical comparison of the
two brains shows that, whether they were separately planned
upon the same general model, or the one was derived from
the other by a process of gradual transformation through
successive intermediate animals, the resemblances are consistent
with either hypothesis. We are remitted, therefore,
to an inquiry for the evidence which will establish the
existence of a race or races of animals through whom there
descended to man the peculiar structure of brain found in
one of the classes of apes&mdash;namely, the Catarrhine or Old
World monkeys. If such intermediate races could be
found, their existence at any period anterior to the period
of man's appearance on earth would have some tendency
to show that man was descended from one of the families
of apes, and this tendency would become stronger in proportion
to the number of successive links in the family
chain that could be made out. But not one of these links
is known to have existed. There is an assumption that
man, "from a genealogical point of view, belongs to the
Catarrhine or Old World stock" of monkeys; and this assumption
is claimed to be supported by the fact that the
character of his brain is fundamentally the same as theirs.</p>

<p>A brain is an organ which, upon the hypothesis of an
independent creation of distinct species of animals, would
be expected to be found in very numerous species, although
they might differ widely from each other. In all the vertebrate
animals this organ is the one from which, by its
connection with the spinal chord, the central portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
nervous system, that system descends through the arches of
the vertebræ, and thence radiates to the various other organs
of the body. The brain is the central seat of sensation,
to which are transmitted, along certain nerves, the
impressions produced upon or arising in the other organs;
and it is the source from which voluntary activity is transmitted
along other nerves to organs and muscles that are
subjected to a power of movement from within. The office
which such an organ performs in a complex piece of animal
mechanism is therefore the same in all the vertebrate animals
in which it is found; and it would necessarily be
found to be constructed upon the same uniform plan, and
with just the degree of uniformity and adaptation which
would fit it to perform its office in the particular species of
animal to which it might be given. In point of fact, we
find this office of the brain performed in all the vertebrate
animals upon the same uniform plan, with the necessary
adaptations to the various structures of the different animals.
Resemblances, therefore, in the convolutions of different
parts of this organ, as found in different vertebrate animals,
however close they may be, prove nothing more than
the adoption of a general plan for the production of objects
common to the whole class of the vertebrate animals; and
unless we can find other and independent proof that one
species was descended from another by connection of lives
with lives through successive generations, the hypothesis of
special creations of the different species is not excluded by
the facts.</p>

<p>Let us now further examine the supposed kinship of
man with the monkey, as evidenced by the similarity of
the structure of the brains of the two animals, in reference
to the supposed process of evolution as the means of accounting
for the origin of two species so essentially distinct.
How has it happened that different species have become
completed and final types, transmitting, after they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
become completed, one and the same type, by the ordinary
process of generation, and not admitting of the sexual
union with any other distinct species? On the theory of
the evolution of animal out of animal, we must suppose
that at some time the secondary causes of natural and sexual
selection have done their work. It ends in the production
of a species which thereafter remains one and the
same animal, and Nature has established a barrier to any
sexual union with any other species. If we give the rein
to our imaginations, and, taking the process of evolution as
it is described to us, suppose that in the long course of
countless ages the struggle for existence among very numerous
individuals has led to gradual transformations of
structure which the sexual selection has transmitted to
offspring, and so a new animal has at length been formed
through the successive "survivals of the fittest," we reach
an animal of a new species, and that species, under no circumstances,
produces any type but its own, so far as we have
any means of knowledge. All the knowledge respecting
the ape that has been accumulated shows only that this
species of animal, since it became a completed type, has
procreated its own type and no other. Whatever struggle
for existence the individuals of this type have had to undergo,
whatever modifications of structure or habits of life
the survival of the fittest individuals of this type may have
produced from the earliest imaginable period until the present
time, the fact remains that this species of animal is a
completed and final product. At the same time we have
another completed and final type of animal known as man,
which, so long as he has been known at all, is a distinct
and peculiar species. Between the brain of this animal and
the brain of the other we find certain strong resemblances.
In each of them this organ is a structure performing the
same office in the animal mechanism, with adaptations peculiar
to the varying structure of each of them. In order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to justify the conclusion that the one animal is a modified
descendant from the other, so as to exclude the hypothesis
that the resemblances of any one or of all of their respective
organs was a result of the adoption of a general plan in
special creations of distinct species, we ought to find some
instance or instances in which the completed animal called
the ape has been developed into an animal approaching
more nearly to man than the man, as he is first known to
us, approached to the first ape that is known to us. Without
such intermediate connections, the analogy of the descent
of individuals from other individuals of the same
species will not hold. There is nothing left but resemblances
of structure in one or more organs, which are just
as consistent with the hypothesis of special creations as
with that of evolution. Strong resemblances of structure
and in the offices of different organs may be found between
man and the horse, but upon no theory of evolution has it
been suggested that man is descended from the horse, or
from any other animal to which he bears more or less resemblance,
excepting the monkey; and it is quite possible
that naturalists have been led unconsciously to make this
exception by external resemblances of the monkey and the
man, by the imitative power of the inferior animal when it
comes in contact with man, and by some of its habits when
found in its wild and native haunts.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>
</div>


<p class="intro">The doctrine of evolution, according to Herbert Spencer, further considered.</p>


<p>In the last two preceding chapters I have examined
what Mr. Spencer regards as the direct supports of the doctrine
of evolution. I have now to consider the different
orders of facts which, as he claims, yield to it indirect
support. These are the facts derived from classification,
from embryology, from morphology, and from distribution.
An explanation is here needful of the sense in which he
uses these respective terms, before the reader, who is not
accustomed to them, is called upon to understand and appreciate
the argument:</p>

<p>1. By classification is meant an arrangement of organic
beings in some systematic manner, according to attributes
which they have in common, and which may form the
principle of a division into different classes or families.
Pointing out that in the early history of botanical and
zoölogical science the tendency was to make classifications
according to a single characteristic, Mr. Spencer reminds
us that later naturalists, by attending to a greater number
of characteristics, and finally to the greatest number that
can be found to be common to various classes of vegetable
and animal organisms, have constructed systems of classification
which, in place of a linear or a serial order, have
exhibited the alliances of different groups, then the sub-groups,
and the sub-sub-groups, so that the divergences
and redivergences become developed, while the resemblances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
which obtain are preserved throughout the whole class.
But it is at once apparent that, although classification, on
whatever principle it is conducted, may be valuable as a
means of fixing in the mind the resemblances or differences
of structure that obtain in the different orders of organized
beings, as, for example, among the vertebrate or the
invertebrate animals, the flowering or the flowerless plants,
the seeds naked or the seeds inclosed in seed-vessels, yet
that any other system of classification, based upon other
resemblances or differences which actually present means
of grouping or separating the different families of organized
beings, is just as valuable an aid in the investigation of facts.
How far any classification affords an argument, or the means
of constructing an argument, which will yield a support to
the doctrine of evolution superior to that which it yields to
the doctrine of special creations, is of course a question.</p>

<p>2. Embryology: This is the term employed to express
that branch of inquiry which is concerned in a comparison
of the increase of different organisms through the stages of
their embryonic life, and in noting at different stages of
this growth the characters which they have in common
with each other; the resemblances of structure which at
corresponding phases of a later embryonic stage are displayed
by a less extensive multitude of organisms; and so
on step by step, until we find the class of resembling embryos
becoming narrower and narrower, and then we finally
end in the species of which a particular embryo is a member.
This process of tracing and eliminating embryonic resemblances
is said to have "a profound significance"; because,
beginning with a great multitude of resemblances between
the embryonic development of different organisms, it reveals
the divergences which they take on, and through every
successive step we find new divergences, by means of which
"we may construct an embryological tree, expressing the
developmental relations of the organisms, resembling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
tree which symbolizes their classificatory relations." We
thus arrive at "that subordination of classes, orders, genera
and species, to which naturalists have been gradually
led," and which is said to be "that subordination which
results from the divergence and redivergence of embryos,
as they all unfold."<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> On this mode of comparing the
embryonic development of different organized beings Mr.
Spencer builds a scientific parallelism, which indicates, as
he claims, a "primordial kinship of all organisms," and a
"progressive differentiation of them," which justifies a belief
in an original stock from which they have all been derived.
In what way this method of investigation destroys
or tends to destroy the hypothesis of special creations, or
how it affords an important support to the doctrine of evolution,
will be considered hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>3. Morphology, or the science of form, involves a comparison
of the structure of different organisms in their
mature state; an ascertainment of the resemblances between
their structures, and of the community of plan that exists
between them. Here, as in the aids derived from classification
and embryology, it is claimed that the fundamental
likenesses of forms of structure have a meaning which is
altogether inconsistent with the hypothesis of predetermined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
typical plans pursued throughout immensely varied forms
of organisms.</p>

<p>4. Distribution: This is the term applied to the phenomena
exhibited by the presence of different organisms in
different localities of the globe; or, as Mr. Spencer phrases
it, "the phenomena of distribution in space." These phenomena
are very various. Sometimes, it is said, we find
adjacent territories, with similar conditions, occupied by
quite different faunas. In other regions, we find closely
allied faunas in areas remote from each other in latitude,
and contrasted in both soil and climate. The reasoning, as
given by Mr. Darwin and adopted by Mr. Spencer, is this:
that "as like organisms are not universally or even generally
found in like habitats, nor very unlike organisms in
very unlike habitats, there is no predetermined adaptation
of the organisms to the habitats." "In other words,"
Mr. Spencer adds, "the facts of distribution in space do
not conform to the hypothesis of design." The reason why
they do not is claimed to be that there are impassable barriers
between the similar areas which are peopled by dissimilar
forms; whereas there are no such barriers between the
dissimilar areas which are peopled by dissimilar forms.
The conclusion is, "that each species of organism tends ever
to expand its sphere of existence&mdash;to intrude on other areas,
other modes of life, other media." That is to say, there is a
constant competition among races of organisms for possession
of the fields in which they can find the means of subsistence
and expansion; and this leads to new modes of existence,
new media of life, new structures and new habitats.</p>

<p>The reader can now retrace his steps, and advert to the
facts that are relied upon, under the four heads of the argument:</p>

<p>1. With regard to the argument derived from classification:
it is to be observed that any system of classification
is in a certain sense artificial, and at all events is manifestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
conventional. But, in order that no injustice may be done
to this branch of the argument for evolution, I shall state
it in its full force. The classifications which naturalists
make of the different organized beings according to their
resemblances and differences reveal the fact of unity amid
multiformity. This fact it is said points to propinquity of
descent, "which is the only known cause of the similarity
of organic beings." It is the bond, hidden indeed by various
degrees of modification, but nevertheless revealed to
us by the classifications which display the resemblances.
Again, we have, it is said, in the influence of various conditions
of animated organisms, "the only known cause of
divergence of structure." Classification reveals to us these
divergences. We have, then, the bond of resemblances
which indicate propinquity of descent, and the divergences
of structure produced by varying conditions of life. Put
the two together, and we have remarkable harmonies of
likenesses obscured by unlikenesses; and to this state of
facts it is claimed that no consistent interpretation can be
given, without the hypothesis that the likenesses and the
unlikenesses were produced by the evolution of organisms
out of organisms by successive generation, through a great
lapse of time.</p>

<p>This argument contains no inconsiderable amount of assumption.
While it may be true that some naturalists do
not assign any cause for the similarity which obtains among
organic beings excepting their descent from a common ancestral
stock, it is not true that the similarity of structure is
inconsistent with the hypothesis of another cause, namely,
the adoption of a general plan of structure for a large class
of organisms, and an intentional variation in those parts of
structure which mark the divisions of that class into species
that are very unlike. It is true that evolutionists treat with
scorn the idea of a pattern of structure followed throughout
a class of animals, but made by designed adaptations to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
coalesce with differences that mark the peculiarities which
distinguish one organism of that class from all the others.
Mr. Spencer, for example, observes that "to say that the
Creator followed a pattern throughout, merely for the purpose
of maintaining the pattern, is to assign a motive which,
if avowed by a human being, we should call whimsical."</p>

<p>Let us now follow this mode of disposing of the hypothesis
of special creations, by adverting to some of the facts
that are adduced in its summary condemnation; and, although
the passage which I am about to quote is found in
Mr. Spencer's work under the head of morphology, the
illustration applies equally well to his argument from classification.
Speaking of fundamental likenesses of structure,
he says: "Under the immensely varied forms of insects,
greatly elongated like the dragon-fly, or contracted in
shape like the lady-bird, winged like the butterfly, or
wingless like the flea, we find this character in common&mdash;there
are primarily twenty segments. These segments may
be distinctly marked, or they may be so fused as to make it
difficult to find the divisions between them. This is not
all. It has been shown that the same number of segments
is possessed by all the <i lang="la">Crustacea</i>. The highly consolidated
crab, and the squilla with its long, loosely-jointed divisions,
are composed of the same number of somites. Though, in
the higher crustaceans, some of these successive indurated
rings, forming the exo-skeleton, are never more than partially
marked off from each other, yet they are identifiable
as homologous with segments, which, in other crustaceans,
are definitely divided. What, now, can be the meaning
of this community of structure among these hundreds
of thousands of species filling the air, burrowing in the
earth, swimming in the water, creeping about among the
sea-weed, and having such enormous differences of size,
outline, and substance, as that no community would be
suspected between them? Why, under the down-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
body of the moth and under the hard wing-cases of the
beetle, should there be discovered the same number of divisions
as in the calcareous framework of the lobster?
It can not be by <em>chance</em> that there exist just twenty segments
in all these hundreds of thousands of species. There
is no reason to think it was <em>necessary</em>, in the sense that no
other number would have made a possible organism. And
to say that it is the result of <em>design</em>&mdash;to say that the Creator
followed this pattern throughout, merely for the purpose
of maintaining the pattern&mdash;is to assign a motive
which, if avowed by a human being, we should call whimsical.
No rational interpretation of this, and hosts of like
morphological truths, can be given except by the hypothesis
of evolution; and from the hypothesis of evolution
they are corollaries. If organic forms have arisen from
common stocks by perpetual divergences and redivergences&mdash;if
they have continued to inherit, more or less
clearly, the characters of ancestral races, then there will
naturally result these communities of fundamental structure
among extensive assemblages of creatures, that have
severally become modified in countless ways and degrees,
in adaptation to their respective modes of life. To this
let it be added that, while the belief in an intentional
adhesion to a predetermined pattern throughout a whole
group is totally negatived by the occurrence of occasional
deviations from the pattern, such deviations are reconcilable
with the belief in evolution. As pointed out in the
last chapter, there is reason to think that remote ancestral
traits will be obscured more or less according as the superposed
modifications of structure have or have not been
great or long maintained. Hence, though the occurrence
of articulate animals, such as spiders and mites, having
fewer than twenty segments, is fatal to the supposition
that twenty segments was decided on for the three groups
of superior <i lang="la">Articulata</i>, it is not incongruous with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
supposition that some primitive races of articulate animals
bequeathed to these three groups this common typical character&mdash;a
character which has nevertheless, in many cases,
become greatly obscured, and in some of the most aberrant
orders of these classes quite lost."<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may be the explanation suggested by one or
another hypothesis as to the mode in which this uniformity
of structure came to exist, it is certain that it does exist.
Twenty segments are found in hundreds of thousands of
species which are immensely different from each other in
size, outline, substance and modes of existence. Here, then,
is a plan. There is a pattern, on which all these different
organisms are constructed with a common peculiarity. It
is averred that this could not have been the result of design,
because this would be to impute to the Creator a whimsical
motive, namely, that he followed the pattern throughout
a vast group of different organisms merely for the purpose
of following it. On the contrary, it may be contended
that this uniformity of plan, this repeated pattern, affords
the highest probable evidence of design; and that the
supposed whimsicality of motive will entirely disappear as
soon as we reach a purpose which may have had very solid
reasons for this uniformity of structure. When we reason
about the works of the Creator, we are reasoning about the
methods of a being who, we must suppose, is governed by a
purpose in all that he does. In reasoning about the methods
of such a being, it is entirely unphilosophical to suppose
that he has done anything merely for the sake of doing it,
or for the sake of exercising or displaying his powers in
repetitions that had no practical value. In order to reason
consistently with the supposed attributes of the Creator,
we should endeavor to find the value of any given pattern
which we discover in a certain very large class of organisms
differing widely from each other in other respects; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
order to find that value it is by no means essential to make
out that the particular plan of construction was necessary
to the making of any organism whatever. The true question
is, not whether twenty segments were necessary to the
construction of any organism, but whether, in each of the
different species, this peculiar number of divisions was useful
to each particular organism. If naturalists of the evolution
school, instead of looking at everything through
the medium of a certain theory, would in their dissection,
for example, of the framework of the lobster, the body of
the moth, and the body of the beetle, furnish us with facts
which would show that these twenty divisions are of no use
either for strength, or resistance, or suppleness, or adaptation
to what is contained within them, we should have a
body of evidence that could be claimed as tending to overthrow
the hypothesis of intentional design. They might
then speak of the repetition of this pattern as whimsical,
upon the hypothesis that it was a repetition by design. But
so little is done by this class of naturalists to give due consideration
to the value of such repetitions, and so little heed
is paid to the truth that the Creator does nothing that is
useless&mdash;a truth which all sound philosophy must assume,
because it is a necessary corollary from the attributes of the
Creator&mdash;that we are left without the aid which we might
expect from these specialists in natural science. Is it, then,
impossible to discover, or even to suggest, that for each of
these organisms this number of twenty divisions had a
value? If they were of no value, we may safely conclude
that they would never have existed, unless we ignore the
hypothesis of infinite wisdom and skill. That hypothesis
is a postulate without which we can not reason on the case
at all. With it, we have as a starting-point the conception
of a being of infinite perfections, who does nothing idly,
nothing from whim, nothing from caprice, and nothing
that is without value to the creature in which it is found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
So that, while we can not in all cases as yet assign that
value, we have the strongest reasons for believing that
there is a value; and, instead of asserting that an extensive
community of structure throughout a great branch of the
animal kingdom has no meaning excepting upon the doctrine
of evolution, it is the part of true science to assume
that it may have another meaning, and to discover if possible
what that other meaning is. This is the part of true
science, because it is the part of sound philosophy. There
is another remark to be made upon Mr. Spencer's reasoning
on this particular case of a community of pattern.
He says that it can not be imputed to <em>chance</em>. It was, then,
either an intentional design, or it came about through the
process of descent "from common stocks, which process
was at the same time producing perpetual divergences and
redivergences." Without turning aside for the present to
ask from how many common stocks, it may be shown as
in the highest degree probable that the occasional deviations
from the pattern did not arise by the evolution process, because
that process has in itself an element of chance which is
fatal to the theory. The assertion is that "an intentional
adhesion to a predetermined plan throughout a whole group
is totally negatived by the occurrence of occasional deviations
from the pattern." Let this assertion be examined first
in the light of facts, and secondly by the absence of facts.</p>

<p>The hypothesis is that some primitive race of articulated
animals, possessed by some means of the twenty segments,
transmitted this ancestral trait to hundreds of thousands of
species having no community of structure in other respects.
Unfortunately for the theory, no figures can measure the
chances against the preservation of a single pattern through
such a multitude of differing organisms descending from
a common stock. Infinity alone can express the chances
against such a result. While, according to the theory, the
deviations from the original type were constantly working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
out new organisms of the most diversified forms, until there
came to be hundreds of thousands of new species differing
from each other in all but this one peculiarity&mdash;a diversity
which is supposed to have been caused by the fundamental
law of evolution&mdash;how did it happen that the same law did
not break this uniformity of articulation? If it was potent
enough to differentiate the enormous multitude of these
animals in all other traits, why did it not vary the number of
segments with which the primitive race was endowed? Is
the law of evolution limited or unlimited? If it is limited in
its effects, then there are patterns of animal structure which
it has not modified, and the presence of which in hundreds
of thousands of different species must be explained as a
form of structure designed for some end that was to be common
to a great multitude of different beings. If the law of
evolution was unlimited in its power, then the community
of pattern has had to undergo chances of destruction or
discontinuance that are immeasurable; as there can be no
measure which will represent to the mind the infinitely
diversified and innumerable causes that have produced the
dissimilarities which compel a classification into the different
species, upon the hypothesis of their descent from a
common stock. Grant, too, for the purpose of the argument,
that the occasional deviations from the pattern of
twenty segments, producing a few groups with a smaller
number of articulations, are reconcilable with the belief that
some later ancestral form became endowed with the smaller
number which it transmitted to its descendants. How
came that later ancestral form to be endowed with the
smaller number of segments? Was there a still more remote
ancestral race, which in some way became possessed
of the smaller number, or did the spiders and the mites, in
the countless generations of evolution, branch off from ancestral
races having the full number of twenty segments?
Upon either supposition, what an infinity of chances there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
were, against the natural selection of the smaller number,
and against its preservation as the unvarying type of articulation
found in the spiders and the mites! The supposition
that the number of twenty segments was decided
on for the three groups of superior <i lang="la">Articulata</i> for the mere
sake of adhering to a pattern is doubtless unphilosophical.
But it is not unphilosophical to suppose that whatever
amount of articulation is found in each species was given
to it because in that species it would be useful. If in some
of the most aberrant orders of these animals the articulation
is greatly obscured, or not found at all, the conclusion
that it was not needed, or not needed in a like degree, is
far more rational than the theory which commits the particular
result to an infinity of chances against it; or which
supposes it to have been worked by a process that might
have produced a very different result, since it can not be
claimed that natural selection works by methods of which
any definite result can be predicated more than another.</p>

<p>Thus far I have considered Mr. Spencer's argument
from the <i lang="la">Articulata</i> in the light of the facts that he adduces.
Let us now test it by the absence of facts. In a former
discussion, I have asked for facts which show, aside from
the theory, that any one species of animal, distinctly
marked as a continuing type, is connected by intermediate
types or forms with any pre-existing race of another character.
Take this class of the articulated animals, said to
be of hundreds of thousands of different species having no
community of form but this of articulation, and now known
as perfect organisms, each after its kind. What naturalist
has discovered the continuity of lives with lives, which
would furnish the steps of descent of any one of this species
from an antecedent and a different species? It is
very easy to construct a theory, and from it to argue that
there must have been intermediate links, which, if discovered,
would show the continuity of lives from lives which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the descent of one organism from another necessarily implies.
To a certain extent, within certain limits, the sub-groups
and the sub-sub-groups of the articulated class of
animals, which classification or morphology reveals, may
lay the foundation for a theoretical belief in an ancestral
stock from which the different and now perfect forms of
these distinct animals may have become developed by successive
changes of structure. But the extent to which
connected changes can be actually traced in the animal
kingdom is extremely limited; and the important practical
question is whether any one fact, or class of facts, has
been discovered which will warrant the belief that beings of
totally dissimilar forms and habits of life have, without any
design, been evolved by the ordinary process of successive
generation, through the operation of causes that have gradually
modified the structure in all respects save one, and
have at the same time enabled or allowed that one peculiarity
of structure to escape from the influences which have
modified both structure and modes of life in every other respect.
Why, for example, upon the hypothesis of descent
from a common stock, has that stock deviated under the
influences of natural selection into the lobster, the moth,
and the beetle, and yet the community of twenty segments
of articulation has entirely escaped the effect of those influences?
No reason can be assigned for the fact that it has
escaped those influences, excepting that it was originally
designed, and was impressed upon the proto-typical stock
with such force as to place it beyond the reach of all such
causes of modification as those which are ascribed to natural
or sexual selection. Without the latter supposition, those
causes were just as potent to bring about a modification in
the number of articulations as they were to bring about
all the astonishing diversities of structure and modes of
life that we see, and therefore the most probable conclusion
from the fact of this uniformity of the twenty segments is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
that there was a barrier placed in this whole class of organisms,
which has limited the modifying force of the supposed
process of evolution, for the reason of some peculiar
utility in this plan of articulation.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be said that the process of evolution itself
tends to the preservation of whatever is most useful,
while the modifications are going on which develop new
organs and new structures; and that thus, in the case before
us, the twenty segments have been preserved throughout
an enormous group by one of the fundamental laws of
evolution, so that, if there is any peculiar utility in the
twenty segments, that utility has been answered by the
very process of gradual descent of one organism from another.
But the difficulty with this reasoning is, that while
it assumes for the modifying influences of natural and
sexual selection a range of fortuitous causes sufficient to
change the ancestral type into the acquisition of vastly
diversified organs, powers, and modes of existence, so as to
constitute new animals, it yet assumes that, by some recognition
of a superior and paramount utility in the particular
number of segments, the law of evolution has preserved
that number from the influence of causes which have
changed everything else. Now, the range of causes which
was sufficiently varied, accidental, long-continued and complex
to produce the diversities of structure in all other
respects, by the infinitely modifying influences which have
developed new organs and new modes of existence, must
also have been of a sufficiently varied, accidental, long-continued,
and complex character to have broken this plan
of the twenty segments, unless we suppose that in some
mysterious and inexplicable manner the different generations
of these beings were endowed with some kind of
sagacity which would enable them to strive for the preservation
of this one peculiarity, or unless we suppose that Nature
was ever on the watch to guard them from its destruc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>tion
or variation, on account of its peculiar utility. The
first supposition is not in accordance with the evolution
theory; for that theory rejects all idea of conscious exertion
on the part of any of the organisms. The second supposition
leads us at once to the inquiry, how came it to be
imposed upon a whole group of beings as a law of nature,
that whatever utility of structure was of paramount importance
to the whole group should be preserved against
the modifying influences that were to produce species differing
absolutely from each other, through hundreds of
thousands of varieties, in every other feature of their existence?
Can we get along here without the hypothesis of
design? And, if there was such design, how does the fact
of this uniformity amid such diversity become an argument
against the hypothesis of a Creator? Or, how does it tend
to displace the hypothesis of special creations, when we
find that the very process of so-called evolution has failed
to break the uniformity of a pattern that is conceded not
to have been the result of chance, although that pattern
was exposed to just as many and as powerful causes of
modification as those which are assumed to have brought
about the modifications in every other feature of the animal
existence? The truth would seem to be, that the
uniformity amid so great a diversity was either the result
of a design which placed it out of the reach of all the
modifying influences, or else it has, by a most incalculable
result, escaped from the effect of those influences by a
chance in which the ratio of one to infinity can alone measure
the probability of such an escape.</p>

<p>Let us now advert to another of Mr. Spencer's illustrations
of the futility of the "supernatural" and of the
rationality of the "natural" interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> This illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>tration
is derived from what are called "homologous" organs;
and the particular instance selected is the vertebral
column.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> There are creatures, such as snakes, a low order
of the vertebrate kingdom, in which the bony axis is divided
into segments of about the same dimensions from end to
end, for the obvious advantage of flexibility throughout the
whole length of the animal. But in most of the higher
vertebrata, some parts of this axis are flexible and others
are inflexible; and this is especially the case in that part of
the vertebral column called the sacrum, which is the fulcrum
that has to bear the greatest strain to which the skeleton
is exposed, and which is yet made not of one long segment
or vertebra, but of several segments "fused together."
Mr. Spencer says: "In man there are five of these confluent
sacral vertebræ; and in the ostrich tribe they number
from seventeen to twenty. Why is this? Why, if the
skeleton of each species was separately contrived, was this
bony mass made by soldering together a number of vertebræ
like those forming the rest of the column, instead of being
made out of one single piece? And why, if typical uniformity
was to be maintained, does the number of sacral
vertebræ vary within the same order of birds? Why, too,
should the development of the sacrum be the roundabout
process of first forming its separate constituent vertebræ, and
then destroying their separativeness? In the embryo of a
mammal or bird, the substance of the vertebral column is, at
the outset, continuous. The segments that are to become
vertebræ, arise gradually in the midst of this originally ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>mogeneous
axis. Equally in those parts of the spine which
are to remain flexible, and in those which are to grow rigid,
these segments are formed, and that part of the spine which
is to compose the sacrum, having passed out of its original
unity into disunity by separating itself into segments,
passes again into unity by the coalescence of these segments.
To what end is this construction and reconstruction? If,
originally, the spine in vertebrate animals consisted from
head to tail of separate movable segments, as it does still in
fishes and some reptiles&mdash;if, in the evolution of the higher
vertebrata, certain of these movable segments were rendered
less movable with respect to each other, by the mechanical
conditions to which they were exposed, and at
length became relatively immovable&mdash;it is comprehensible
why the sacrum formed out of them should continue ever
after to show more or less clearly its originally segmented
structure. But on any other hypothesis this segmented
structure is inexplicable."</p>

<p>We here see the predominating force of a theory which
refuses all possible rationality to any hypothesis but its
own. The confident tone with which facts are arrayed and
are then pronounced inexplicable upon any other hypothesis
than that which the writer asserts, without one scintilla
of proof of their tendency to exclude every other supposition,
renders the refutation of such reasoning a wearisome
task. But there is here one plain and sufficient answer to
the whole of the supposed difficulty. The evolution theory,
in this particular application of it, is that originally there
were vertebrate animals in which the spine consisted of
separate movable segments from head to tail, as it does now
in fishes and reptiles; but, as the higher vertebrata were
evolved out of these lower forms, the movable segments
were rendered less movable with respect to each other, and
at length in the sacrum the segments became relatively immovable,
and yet the originally segmented structure was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
retained in this part of the column, by force of the propinquity
of descent from an antecedent type which had
the whole column divided into movable segments. Upon
no other hypothesis, it is asserted, is this result explicable.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer's analysis of the sacrum is somewhat defective.
It is, as he says, that part of the vertebrate column
which in the higher class of vertebrate animals is, during
fœtal life, composed, like all the rest of the column, of distinct
vertebræ. These vertebræ, like the others, are flexible
in the fœtal stage, but after birth they become coalesced
or united into one piece, instead of remaining in separate
pieces. Thus far, Mr. Spencer's description is, I am informed
by anatomists, correct. But the questions which
he propounds as if they were unanswerable upon the assumption
that this change is inexplicable upon any other
hypothesis than that of the evolution of the higher vertebrata
out of the lower vertebrate animals, and that the
sacrum, with its continuous piece, has retained the segmented
outward form by force of the descent, demand
closer consideration. Let us trace the process of formation
in the human species, and then see what is the just conclusion
to be derived from it. In the embryonic condition,
the substance which is to form the vertebral column
is continuous. As the fœtus is developed, this substance
separates itself into the segments which are called vertebræ,
and these segments remain flexible and movable throughout
the column. After birth, the five lower segments become
united in what is substantially one piece, but of course the
marks of the original segments remain. This is what occurs
in the origin and growth of the individual. Now,
looking back to the period when this species of animal did
not exist, and supposing it to have been specially created in
the two related forms of male and female, endowed with
the same process of procreation and gestation that has been
going on ever since there is any recorded or traditionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
knowledge of the race, why should not this very growth of
the sacrum have been designed, in order to produce, after
the birth of the individual, that relative rigidity which
would in this part of the vertebral column be useful to an
animal destined to an upright posture of the whole skeleton
and to the habits and life of a biped? And, if we extend the
inquiry to other species, why should we not expect to find,
as in the case of an oviparous vertebrate like the ostrich,
a repetition of the same general plan of forming the spinal
column, for the same ultimate purpose, with such a variation
in the number of original segments that are to constitute
the sacrum as would be most useful to that bird, thus
establishing for the ostrich a sacrum that in a reptile or a
fish would not only not be required, but would be a positive
incumbrance? Upon the hypothesis of special creations of
the different species of vertebrate animals, every one of Mr.
Spencer's questions, asked as if they were unanswerable, can
receive a satisfactory solution. Thus, he asks, "Why, if the
skeleton of each species was separately contrived, was this
bony mass [the sacrum] made by soldering together a number
of vertebræ like those forming the rest of the column,
instead of being made [aboriginally] in one single piece?"
The answer is, that in the establishment of the process of
gestation and fœtal growth, if a human artificer and designer
could have devised the process, he would have selected
the very one that now exists, for certain obvious
reasons. First, he would have designedly made the process
to consist, in the embryo, of a division of the substance
which was to form the vertebral column in a continuous
and uniform division into segments, because the whole column
is to have at first the flexibility that may be derived
from such a division. Secondly, when the time was to
arrive at which the formation of the sacrum, with its
practical continuity of a single piece, was to commence, he
would select the number of the lower vertebræ that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
make a sacrum most useful to the particular species of animal,
and would weld them together so as to give them the
relative rigidity and action of a single piece. But as the
whole formation is the result of a growth of the sacrum
out of a part of the slowly forming column originally
divided into vertebræ, the marks of these separate vertebræ
would remain distinguishable, while they would cease to
have the mechanical action of separate vertebræ.</p>

<p>Another of Mr. Spencer's questions is, "Why, if typical
uniformity was to be maintained, does the number of sacral
vertebræ vary within the same order of birds?" The answer
is the same as that which assigns a reason for all other
variations in the skeleton of animals of the same order but
of different varieties, namely, the special utility of the
variations in the number of sacral vertebræ that would be
most useful in that variety. The typical uniformity maintained
is a uniformity in the process of growth and formation,
down to a point where the variations are to come in
which mark one animal from another; and I have more
than once had occasion to suggest that the typical uniformity,
and its adaptation to the varying requirements of different
beings, is the highest kind of moral evidence of the
existence, wisdom, and power of a supreme artificer, and
that it militates so strongly against the doctrine of evolution
that, without more proof than can possibly be claimed for
that doctrine, we ought not to yield to it our belief.</p>

<p>The theory that the original condition of all vertebrate
animals was that of separate movable segments throughout
the spinal column, as it is now in fishes and some reptiles,
and that in the evolution of the higher vertebrates out of
these lower forms, certain of these movable segments were
rendered less movable with respect to each other by the mechanical
conditions to which the successive generations were
exposed, until at length the sacrum was formed, is undoubtedly
a theory that excludes all design of an infinite artificer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and all intention whatever. It is a theory which relegates
the most special contrivances and the most exact adaptations
to the fortuitous operation of causes that could not have
produced the variations of structure and at the same time
have preserved the typical uniformity. It is certainly a
theory which we should not apply to the works of man, if
we were investigating products which seemed to be the result
of human ingenuity and skill, but of the origin of
which we had no direct evidence. In such a case, we
should not shut our eyes to the proofs of intentional variations
and adaptation, or, if we did, our speculations would
not be likely to command the assent of cultivated and
sound reasoners. We may treat the works of Nature by a
system of logic that we should not apply to the works of
man, but if we do, we shall end in no tenable results. The
principal and in fact the only essential distinction to be observed
between the works of Nature and the works of man
relates to the degree of power, intelligence, and skill in the
actor. If we assume, as we must, that in the one case there
was an actor, applying will, intelligence, and power to the
properties of matter, and molding it into certain products
and uses, and that in the other case there was no actor,
but that all products and results are but the ungoverned
effects of what are called natural laws in contradistinction
to all intentional purposes, we must argue upon principles
that are logically and diametrically inconsistent in themselves,
and at variance with fundamental laws of reasoning.</p>

<p>I will now advert to an omission in Mr. Spencer's analysis
of the sacrum, which overlooks one of the strongest
proofs of intentional design afforded by that part of the
spinal column. We have seen what was its general purpose
and growth, and the process of its formation. We have now
to note its variations in the male and the female skeleton.
In the male, the sacrum, thus formed before birth, after birth
answers to and performs its ultimate function of a compara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>tively
rigid and inflexible piece of bone, and it is provided
with no other special characteristic. In the female, on the
contrary, there is a most remarkable adaptation of this piece
to the function of maternity. While all the upper vertebræ
of which this piece was originally composed are welded together
after birth in the female as in the male, in the female
the lowest segment of all remains for a certain time flexible
relatively to the upper part of the sacrum, in order to admit
of the necessary expansion of the pelvis during the passage
of the infant from the womb of the mother. In the normal
condition of females of all the vertebrate orders, this flexibility
of the lower part of the sacrum continues while the period
of possible maternity continues. If in any individual
female it happens to be wanting during the period of possible
conception, delivery can not take place without danger
to the mother or the offspring, or both. Hence, in
very bad cases, nature has to be assisted by extraordinary
means. But in the normal condition of the female sacrum,
this flexibility, so essential in the process of safe delivery,
is always found, and its special purpose is known to every
anatomist, while it has no existence in the structure of the
male. Is this distinction to be accounted for by the same
kind of reasoning that undertakes to account for all the
other great distinctions between the related forms of male
and female, which reproduce their kind by a common process
of the sexual union, namely, that this division of male
and female came about by a habit that resulted now in the
production of a male and now in the production of a female,
from tendencies that were ungoverned by any special
purpose? Must we not conclude, however inscrutable are
the causes that determine the sex of a particular infant,
that the sexes themselves were specially ordained? And if
they were specially ordained, how are we to account for the
special construction and function of each of them, without
the interposition of a special design? And when we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
a structure in the female obviously designed for a special
purpose, and not existing in the male, are we to conclude that
some particular race of females, in some remote period of
antiquity, among the countless generations of the vertebrata,
found that this flexibility of the sacrum would be
highly convenient to them, and, having adopted it as a
habit, transmitted it, as a specially acquired peculiarity of
structure, to their female descendants? This is all very well
as a theoretical speculation, but as a speculation it is entirely
defective, because it assigns the peculiarity of structure
to a cause that could not have produced it. On the other
hand, the hypothesis of its special creation assigns it to a
cause that could have produced it, and its existence is
among the highest of the multitudinous evidences of intentional
design and special formation.</p>

<p>Wherein consists the irrationality of the hypothesis that
a plan of construction was intentionally, and with supreme
skill, framed for very different beings, to answer in each of
them a common purpose? The asserted irrational character
of this hypothesis consists in nothing but a denial that
there was a Creator. It comes down to this, if it comes to
anything: because, if we assume that there was a Supreme
Being who took any care whatever of the complex and
manifold product that we call nature&mdash;if we suppose that
he ordained anything&mdash;we must suppose that his power to
construct was boundless, and that a repetition of his plans
wherever they would be useful, to answer the beneficent
and diversified ends of infinite skill and benevolence, is
just as much in accordance with the whole hypothesis of
his attributes as it is to suppose that he caused anything
whatever to exist. If we deny his existence, if we can not
satisfy ourselves of it at all, if we suppose that nothing was
ordained, nothing was created, but that all these diversified
forms of animal organisms grew out of a protoplasmic
substance, and that there was never any absolute commence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>ment
of organic life on the globe, or any absolute commencement
of anything whatever, it is of course idle to
speculate upon the adoption or preservation of patterns, as
it is equally idle to pursue the theory of evolution through
stages which at last end nowhere whatever.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>It may be well to cite Mr. Spencer's final summary of
the general truths which he claims to be revealed by morphology,
because it will enable the reader to see just where
the logical inconsequence of his position occurs: "The
general truths of morphology thus coincide in their implications.
Unity of type, maintained under extreme dissimilarities
of form and mode of life, is explicable as resulting
from descent with modification; but is otherwise
inexplicable. The likenesses disguised by unlikenesses,
which the comparative anatomist discovers between various
organs in the same organisms, are worse than meaningless
if it be supposed that organisms were severally
formed as we now see them; but they fit in quite harmoniously
with the belief that each kind of organism is a product
of accumulated modifications upon modifications. And the
presence, in all kinds of animals and plants, of functionally
useless parts corresponding to parts that are functionally
useful in allied animals and plants, while it is totally incongruous
with the belief in a construction of each organism by
miraculous interposition, is just what we are led to expect
by the belief that organisms have arisen by progression."<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Without expending much criticism upon the phrase
"miraculous interposition," as a description of what takes
place in special creation, it is sufficient to say that the act
of special creation of a distinct organism is to be first viewed
by itself, as if it stood alone in nature, and that it is like
any other act of causing a new thing to exist which did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
exist before. To this idea should be added the fact that
in the creation of an animal organism there is involved the
direct formation of a peculiar type of animal, with a capacity
of producing other individuals of the same type through
a process of generation. When, after having attained this
conception of the act of special creation, and contemplated
a single instance of the supposed exercise of such a power,
we extend our inquiries, we find many other instances of
the exercise of the same power; and then we observe a certain
unity of type in some peculiarity of structure, maintained
under extreme dissimilarities of form and mode of
life. How, then, is this one similarity of pattern, amid
such multiformity in other respects, "worse than meaningless,"
if we suppose that "organisms were severally framed
as we now see them"? The very hypothesis that they
were so severally framed carries in itself a meaning which
can not be thus summarily ignored; because that hypothesis
implies a power in the Creator to do just what we see.
You may deny the power; but if you admit the existence
of the infinite creating power, you are remitted to the inquiry
into its probable methods; and you can no more say
that the special creation of distinct organisms, with a certain
unity amid a great multiformity, leaves the whole
phenomena without a meaning, than you can say that any
method which you can suggest is necessarily the only method
which will afford a rational meaning in what we see.
You must go the length of denying the entire postulate of
a Creator, before you can be in a situation to deny the
meaning that is involved in the idea of creation; for that
idea implies an absolute power to apply a uniform pattern
of structure to a whole class of organisms varied in all other
respects. The theory that each kind of organism is a
product of accumulated modifications upon modifications,
without any special interposition to produce the modified
and distinct forms, must be maintained on one of two sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>positions:
either that at some period there was an absolute
commencement of organic life in some form, upon this
globe, and that then all the other forms which we see were
left to be evolved out of that one by the ungoverned accumulation
of modifications upon modifications, or else
that there was never any absolute commencement of organic
life at any time, but that matter, by some peculiar property
derived from some source that is not suggested, took on
combinations which resulted in some crude form of animated
organism, and that then the accumulations of modifications
upon modifications followed from some process
of generation by which the successive organisms became
multiplied and varied. Of the former supposition, I understand
Mr. Darwin to have been a representative naturalist.
Of the latter, I understand Mr. Spencer to be an
advocate. Upon what may be called the Darwinian doctrine,
the idea of a Creator, causing to exist at some time
some crude form of animal life, is admitted. Upon the
Spencerian doctrine, which will be in this respect more
closely examined hereafter, I do not see that the idea of a
creating power comes in anywhere, either at the commencement
of a series of organisms or at any point in that series.
But, upon the logical proposition asserted in the passage last
above quoted, it is obvious that, unless the idea of a Creator
is absolutely denied, the presence of a unity of type amid any
amount of dissimilarities of form and mode of life can not
be pronounced to be without meaning, because the idea of
a Creator implies a power to make that very unity amid the
uniformity, which is asserted to be inexplicable without resorting
to the theory that it was not made at all, but that
it grew out of events over which no superintending or governing
power was exercised. Upon this kind of dogmatic
assertion there can be no common ground of reasoning.</p>

<p>The assumed incongruity between the facts and the
hypothesis of a special creation of each organism is an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>congruity
that arises out of the assumption that such special
creation was an impossibility. If once the idea of an
infinite creating faculty is assumed as the basis of the reasoning,
all seeming incongruity vanishes, and the probable
method of that creating power must be determined by the
preponderance of evidence. If the power is denied, we
must grope our way through systems which impute everything
to the properties of substance, without any suggestion
of a source from which those properties were derived,
and without anything to guide them but the tendencies
implanted in them, we know not how or when, and of the
origin of which we have not even a suggestion. Some of
the speculations of Greek philosophers adverted to in a
previous chapter may serve to show us what comes of the
omission to conceive of power as abstracted from substance
or its properties. The philosophy which first attained to
this conception led the way to that conception of an Infinite
Being, without whose existence and attributes all speculation
upon the phenomena of nature leads to nothing. A
belief in his existence and attributes must undoubtedly be
attained by an examination of his works, if we set aside the
teachings of revealed religion. But if we can not attain it,
we have no better means for believing in the doctrine of
evolution than we have for believing in any other method by
which the phenomena of nature have become what they are.</p>

<p>The question here is, not whether descent of organisms
from organisms, with modifications upon modifications,
is a supposable theory, but whether it is so satisfactorily
shown that it can be said to exclude the hypothesis of a
special creation of each organism. There may be parts of
structure in one animal which seem to have no functional
use, although we should be cautious in making the assumption
that they are of no use because we have not yet discovered
that use. But let it be assumed that these apparently
useless parts in one animal correspond to parts which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
in another animal are functionally useful. If there was
established for these two separately created animals a like
system of procreation and gestation, that system, affected
at the same time by a law of growth imposed by the special
type of the species, might in one species lead to the presence
of parts of which we can not recognize the use, and
might in other species lead to the presence of parts of
which we can see the use. It does not help to a better explanation
to say that there has been an accumulation of
modifications upon modifications in the course of an unknown
descent of one organism from another. Why did
these modifications stop short of the production of a species
or of several species in which no resemblance of parts
more or less functionally useful could be found? The
supposition is that the modifications have been going on
through millions of years. Time enough, therefore, has
elapsed for the destruction of all uniformity of structure;
and the causes of modification are as immeasurable as the
period through which they are supposed to have been
operating. The imaginary ancestral stock, wherever it is
placed in the line of remote descent, had, in its first distinctive
existence, a peculiar structure, which it bequeaths
to its offspring. In the countless generations of its descendants,
modifications of that structure take place, until
a new animal is evolved. What preserved any unity of
type from the modifying influences? It was not choice
on the part of the several descending species; not a conscious
exertion to preserve something; it was nothing but
the propinquity of descent, which by the law of heredity
transmitted certain resemblances. But why was that law
so potent that it could preserve a certain unity of type, and
at the same time so powerless as not to prevent the modifications
which the successive organisms have undergone in
all other respects? Or, to reverse the terms of the question,
why were the causes of modification sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
powerful to produce distinct species, and yet not powerful
enough to eliminate the resemblances which we find obtaining
throughout the whole group of animals to which these
several species belong? It would seem that here we are not
to lose sight of the fact that, in the animal kingdom, procreation
never takes place between a male and a female of
distinct species, and that we have no reason to believe that
it ever did take place. Now, although the evolution hypothesis
supposes that, starting from an ancestral stock,
the modifications of structure have been produced in offspring
descended from parents of that same stock, which
have transmitted acquired peculiarities to their immediate
progeny, and so on indefinitely, yet there must have been
a time when the diverging species became distinct and peculiar
organisms, and when it became impossible for any
crossing of these organisms to take place. All the supposed
modifications, therefore, have taken place within the limits
of an actual descent of one kind of animal from another,
each successive pair belonging to the species from which
they were individually generated. In this descent of lives
from lives, there came about changes which in progress of
time led to two animals as wide asunder as the man and
the ostrich, or as the man and the horse, and yet the causes
which were powerful enough to produce these widely diverging
species were not powerful enough to break up all
unity of plan in some one or more respects. If naturalists
of the evolution school would explain how there has
come to be, for example, in the skeleton of the <i lang="la">vertebrata</i>,
a bony structure called the spine, in which a certain resemblance
and a certain function obtain throughout the whole
class, and yet one species creeps upon its belly, another
walks on four legs, and another on two, and one flies in the
air and another never can do so, and how this could be
without any design or special interposition of a creating
power, but that the whole of this uniformity amid such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
diversity has arisen from acquired habits among the different
descendants from an aboriginal stock that had no such
habits in either mode of locomotion, and no organs for such
modes of life, they would at least be able to commend their
theory to a better appreciation of its claims than is now
possible to those who want "grounds more relative" than
a naked hypothesis.</p>

<p>3. The argument from embryology requires for its appreciation
a careful statement of its abstract proposition,
and a statement of it in a concrete form. As an abstract
proposition, embryology, or the comparison of the development
of different organisms under their embryonic stages,
shows that in the earliest stage of any organism it has
the greatest number of characters in common with all
other organisms in their earliest stage; that at a later
stage its structure is like the structures displayed at corresponding
phases by a less extensive number of organisms;
that at each subsequent stage the developing embryo becomes
more and more distinguished from the groups of embryos
that it previously resembled; and that this divergence
goes on, until we reach the species of which the embryo
is a member, in which the class of similar forms is finally
narrowed to that species.</p>

<p>It seems that Von Baer formulated this generalization
of embryologic development into an "embryologic law,"
which, according to Mr. Spencer, becomes a support to the
hypothesis of evolution in this way: Species that had a
common ancestry will exhibit a parallelism in the embryonic
development of their individual members. As the
embryos of the ancestral stock were developed in their
growth, so the embryos of the descended species would be
developed at corresponding phases in a similar way. As
one species diverged from its ancestral stock, there would
come about modifications in the development of its embryos,
and thus a later ancestral stock would be formed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
which would in turn transmit to its descendants in the development
of the embryo less and less resemblances, and
so on, until finally the individual animal, at birth, would
structurally resemble only the individual infants of its own
race.</p>

<p>Here, then, is another remarkable instance of the force
of an adopted theory. First, we have a comparison of the
embryonic development of different animals from their
seminal germs which displays certain phenomena of resemblances
and departures. Next, we have the assumption of
an ancestral stock, the common origin of all the organisms
in the development of whose embryos among its descendants
an embryologic law was to work, starting from the
visible resemblance of all the germs, then exhibiting structural
changes into later ancestral stocks, and so on, until
the resemblances are reduced to those which obtain only
among individuals of the same species. So that, without
the hypothesis, the assumption of an ancestral stock of all
the organisms, formed somehow in the course of descent
from a germ that gave rise to an animal of some kind, we
have nothing to which to apply the embryologic law. We
are to infer the embryologic law from the parallelism of
embryonic development which prevails in the whole series
of animal generation, or from its divergences, or from both,
and then we draw from <em>this law</em> the inference that the
whole series of animals came from some common stock.
The difficulty with this whole theory is, as I have more
than once suggested, that we have no means, aside from the
theory itself, of connecting lives with lives, in the generation
of one distinct species out of another. Without some
proof of the fact that the human fœtus was a diverging
growth out of some ancestral stock that was the same as
that from which the fœtus of another animal was a different
diverging growth, the embryologic law is no help to us
whatever. If this kinship of the human fœtus with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
fœtus of some other animal can not be found, by tracing
the intermediate links which carry them respectively back
to their common ancestor, between what animals in respect
to their embryonic development can such kinship be
found, excepting upon the theoretical assumption of a common
origin of the whole vertebral class? If there was such
a common ancestral stock, where is it to be placed, what
was its character, when did the law of embryologic development
begin to operate upon its descendants? Until some
facts can be adduced which will have a satisfactory tendency
to show the kinship of one animal with another by
reason of ancestral descent from a common ancestral stock
that was unlike either of them, the phenomena of embryologic
development have no tendency to displace the hypothesis
of special creations; for, on the latter hypothesis,
the phenomena of resemblances and differences in the
growth from the germ into the fœtus and from the fœtus
into the newly born infant, evinced by any range of comparison
of the different species, would be the same. If man
was a special creation, and one of the higher quadrumana
was also a distinct and separate creation, the establishment
for each of a like process of procreation and gestation
would produce all the resemblances of fœtal growth that
obtain between them, and the ordained differences of their
animal destinies would explain all the divergences. Let us
see if this is not a rational conclusion.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult for the common reader of such
a work as that of Mr. Spencer, on which I am now commenting,
to avoid the influence of the perpetual assertion
that facts are explicable upon one hypothesis alone. At
each step in the argument, the array of facts terminates
with the assertion that, upon the hypothesis of design, the
facts are inexplicable; and yet we are furnished with no
reasoning that has a tendency to show that the facts necessarily
exclude the hypothesis of design, or, in other words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
that the facts are inconsistent with that hypothesis. It is
essential to understand what is the true scope of the hypothesis
of special creation; for, without a definite idea of
what that term implies, we have no proper means of comparing
the facts of animal resemblances or differences with the
rationality of the hypothesis that they resulted from an intentional
design. Recollecting, then, that we are now pursuing
the resemblances and divergences that are found in a
comparison of the embryologic development of different
species of animals, let us endeavor to understand the meaning
of what I have suggested at the close of the last preceding
paragraph; namely, the establishment for a large
class of animals of a like general system of procreation and
gestation, and the ordination of different destinies for the different
species of animals belonging to that class. I have
said that the two branches of this hypothesis would account
for the resemblances in the embryological growth of different
animals, and would explain the divergences which obtain
among their embryological developments. The first
inquiry is, whether this hypothesis presents a true philosophic
idea of special creation. The next inquiry is, whether it
affords a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena of comparative
embryologic development.</p>

<p>We must never lose sight of the one grand postulate of
an infinite Creator. This postulate must be conceded to
the believers in special creations, because any idea of creation
implies a creating power. If we conceive of creation
without a Creator, we must stop all argument. Now, the
hypothesis of creation, as I have more than once said, implies
a being of boundless faculties. There can be absolutely
no limitation to the power of such a being, either in
respect to the methods by which he will accomplish his
objects, or to the number and variety of these objects, or to
the purposes for which they are to exist. If we narrow our
conception of creating power to anything less than an infi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>nite
faculty; if we suppose it to be restricted in any direction;
if we argue about it as if there were things that it
can not do, we shall be without the means of reasoning
soundly upon anything that it is supposed to have done.
It is quite otherwise when we are reasoning about the operation
and effect of secondary causes. There is no secondary
cause&mdash;no imaginable operation of a fixed quality of
substance&mdash;no action of any of the properties of substance&mdash;that
is not limited. The scope of its action may be very
wide; within its sphere it may be enormously potent; but
in its very nature it is bounded.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> It is not so with the First
Cause of all things; not so with the Infinite Power which,
upon the hypothesis of a First Cause, has established all
the physical laws of the universe and all the properties of
matter. So that, when we reason about the methods of that
infinite creating power, if we find a general system established,
or a pattern repeated through a very large class of
organisms, the proper inference is, not that the power was
limited, but that it has been exercised to the whole extent
of what was useful, and in that direction has been exercised
no further; and if we find variations or additional structures
incorporated with the repetition of a general pattern,
the proper inference is that the unlimited creating power
has put forth all the additional exertion and skill needful
for the formation of new beings.</p>

<p>What, then, does the establishment of a like system of
procreation and gestation imply, upon the supposition of
the distinct creation of species? It implies a certain parallel
embryonic development, from the germ to the fœtus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
and from the fœtus to the new-born infant, throughout
a large group of different animals; and this parallelism
would in certain stages of the embryonic growth display
identity or close similarity of form and structure. But as
in each species of animal the distinct creation would necessarily
imply a distinct destiny, the parallelism of embryonic
form and structure would cease at the point of development
at which the characteristic structure of the species
would begin to unfold itself. The general system of
procreation and gestation common to a whole class of different
animals, and the ordained diversity of species, would
present the same phenomena of resemblances and differences
in the embryonic development that are supposed to
be explicable only by the hypothesis of a descent of all the
species from a common ancestral stock through the process
of evolution.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the mystery and obscurity in which
the process of animal procreation is involved&mdash;a mystery
and obscurity which will perhaps never be fully solved&mdash;we
can see enough to warrant some definite conclusions. One
of these conclusions is that, in the formation of the germ
which becomes developed into the fœtus, the male and female
parent each contributes some cellular substance to the
compound which constitutes that germ. We may safely
infer this, because the individual animal becomes a union
of characteristics belonging to both the parents, although
the traits that are peculiar to one of the parents may be
more or less marked in their different offspring, so that
in one of the descendants the paternal and in another the
maternal traits will predominate. But in every descendant
from the same pair there is more or less of the peculiarities
of each parent plainly discernible. The inference,
therefore, may be safely drawn that the male and the
female parent each contributes to the formation of the
ante-fœtal germ some cellular substance, in which resides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the typical characteristic of animal organism which each
parent possesses. The compound germ that is thus formed
is endowed with the mysterious principle of animal life
which admits of growth and development; and whether
after its formation the female parent bestows most or bestows
least upon the product, that product consists of a
union of cellular substances contributed by both the male
and the female parent in the sexual act of procreation.
This compound resultant germ, in the earliest stage of its
formation, like the separate cells of which it is a union,
exhibits no visible difference when we compare the ante-fœtal
germ of one animal with that of a different animal.
Perhaps we shall never be able to detect either chemical or
mechanical differences in the cellular substances or in the
earliest stage of the compound product which has resulted
from their union. But in that compound product there
resides a contributory cellular substance derived from each
of the parents; and it is a just inference from this fact, and
from what we learn when we trace the further development,
that there is a peculiar and typical structure impressed
upon and inwrapped in this compound germ, which
is to grow into a fœtal development by a law of its own.
There will at the same time be a particular law of development
for each distinct species of animal, and a general law
of development for a great variety of species among whom
there obtains a common process of the sexual union and of
the contribution of male and female cellular substance.
When the fœtus becomes formed, there will still be marked
resemblances in the different species, before the stage is
reached at which the characteristic structure of each species
is to begin to unfold itself. But at some time the fundamental
difference of structure originally lodged in the
cellular substances of which the compound ante-fœtal germ
was composed, and impressed upon that germ as the type
which was gradually to unfold itself into a distinct being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
will begin to exert its force. The resemblances of structure
will become less and less, as the fœtus of the different animals
approaches to the time of birth. Organs, or appearances
of organs, which at one stage of the comparison have
seemed to indicate descent from a common ancestral stock,
but which may have been only the result of a common process
of fœtal development, will be found to be varied by
force of the original diversity of structure and destiny that
was made to reside in the seminal substance of each distinct
species of animal; and, at length, this original and
intentional peculiarity of structure and being would become
perfected at or before the period when birth is to
take place, leaving only those resemblances which must
obtain in all organisms constructed in certain respects upon
a uniform plan, and brought into being by a common process
of procreation and gestation.</p>

<p>Let us now see whether this reasoning involves any
such unphilosophical or unscientific belief as is supposed.
Passing by the often-repeated assertion that the facts of
comparative embryologic development are reconcilable only
with the belief in evolution, let us advert to some of those
facts. "The substitutions," says Mr. Spencer, "of organs
and the suppression of organs, are among those secondary
embryological phenomena which harmonize with the belief
in evolution, but can not be reconciled with any other belief.
There are cases where, during its earlier stages of
development, an embryo possesses organs that afterward
dwindle away, as there arise other organs to discharge the
same functions. And there are cases where organs make
their appearance, grow to certain points, have no functions
to discharge, and disappear by absorption." The concrete
illustration of this substitution and suppression of organs is
thus given by Mr. Spencer:</p>

<p>"We have a remarkable instance of this substitution in
the successive temporary appliances for aërating the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
which the mammalian embryo exhibits. During the first
phase of its development, the mammalian embryo circulates
its blood through a system of vessels distributed over what is
called the <i lang="la">area vasculosa</i>, a system of vessels homologous with
one which, among fishes, serves for aërating the blood until
the permanent respiratory organs come into play. After a
time, there buds out from the mammalian embryo a vascular
membrane called the allantois, homologous with one
which, in birds and reptiles, replaces the first as a breathing
apparatus. But while, in the higher oviparous vertebrates,
the allantois serves the purpose of a lung during the rest
of embryonic life, it does not do so in the mammalian embryo.
In implacental mammals it aborts, having no function
to discharge; and in the higher mammals it becomes
"placentiferous, and serves as the means of intercommunication
between the parent and the offspring"&mdash;becomes an
organ of nutrition more than of respiration. Now, since
the first system of external blood-vessels, not being in contact
with a directly oxygenated medium, can not be very
serviceable to the mammalian embryo as a lung; and since
the second system of external blood-vessels is, to the implacental
embryo, of no greater avail than the first; and
since the communication between the embryo and the placenta
among placental mammals might as well or better
have been made directly, instead of by metamorphosis of
the allantois&mdash;these substitutions appear unaccountable as
results of design. But they are quite congruous with the
supposition that the mammalian type arose out of lower
vertebrate types. For, in such case, the mammalian embryo,
passing through states representing, more or less distinctly,
those which its remote ancestors had, in common
with the lower <i lang="la">vertebrata</i>, develops these subsidiary organs
in like ways with the lower vertebrata."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>In what way, then, are these substitutions unaccountable
as results of design, and why are they any more congruous
with the supposition that the mammalian type
arose out of the lower vertebrate type? In the first place,
it is necessary to have a distinct conception of what is
meant by design. In the present case, it means that for
a certain large group of animals there was established a
system of reproduction by the sexual union of male and
female, each contributing a cellular substance peculiar to
itself, in the formation of a compound cellular substance in
which the separate substances are united, and which is to
be developed into the fœtus by a law of growth; and as a
further design there is wrapped up in the compound germ
of each distinct species of animal a typical plan of ultimate
form and structure. This typical plan can not be detected
in the germ itself, as it is too subtile and obscure even for
the microscope; but we have every reason to believe that it
is there in all its distinctness of original purpose, because
at a later stage of the embryonic development we find a distinct
species of animal is the result. This is a conclusion
that must be adopted by the evolutionist, as well as by the
believer in special creations, because it has nothing to do
with the question of how distinct species came to exist.
Whether they were designedly and separately created, or
were evolved out of one another, the reproductive process
by which the individuals of the same species are brought
into being alike involves the conclusion that, in the ante-fœtal
germ of that species, there is somehow involved, in a
form so minute that it can not be seen, the type of animal
which is to belong to that species, and to no other. Here,
then, we have the grand and compound design which is to
obtain throughout a whole group of different animals;
namely, that they shall multiply in the production of individuals
of their own types, by a sexual union, in which
the male and the female each contributes a cellular sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>stance
of its own to the formation of a compound germ,
and in that germ there is made to reside the typical form
and structure of a distinct organism, so minute that we
can not see it, but which we must conclude from the result
has been put there to be developed by a law of growth ordained
for the accomplishment of a certain distinct order
of beings. But the very obscurity of this type, in the earliest
stage of embryonic development, leads to the conclusion
that while it will never be lost, so long as its life is preserved,
it will unfold itself in ways that will be equally beyond our
ken, until the point is reached where it is no longer obscured,
but where it is revealed in all its distinctness of
outline and its peculiarity of structure. What is certain
and invariable is, that the type peculiar to the species is at
some time in the growth of the individual animal perfectly
developed. But in the modes of its development through
different embryonic stages, there will be variations and substitutions
of organs in the different species, but in each distinct
species these variations and substitutions will be uniformly
the same, because the law of development imposed
by the distinct type, while it may operate differently among
different species, will always operate in the same way in the
same species. Thus in one animal the development from
the original type which was implanted in its seminal ante-fœtal
germ may at one stage exhibit an organ for which at
a later stage another organ will be substituted; and in another
animal a seemingly corresponding organ may serve a
different purpose, or may altogether abort. These embryologic
phenomena, varying in different species, but occurring
uniformly in the same species, are necessarily among
the most obscure of all the phenomena of animal life, on
account of the fact that they take place where we can not
watch the changes or modifications as they are taking place
during actual fœtal life. But they are no more explicable
upon the hypothesis of the descent of distinct animals from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
a common stock, than they are upon the hypothesis of distinct
creations of species. Upon the former hypothesis,
the assumed propinquity of descent implies the preservation
of the same mode of embryonic development until it
becomes varied by the operation of causes that bring about
a new habit of development, and then a fixation in this new
habit after a new species or a new ancestral stock is formed;
so that in each distinct species there comes at length to be
a uniform process of substituting and suppressing organs,
or changing the functions of organs. But how are we to
account for the operation of causes that have preserved a
parallelism of development, along with the operation of
causes that have produced the different modes of development,
when all the species are supposed to be derived from
a common ancestral stock, which first began to procreate
and to develop its descendants in one and the same way?
What are the facts which will enable us to say that the
mammalian type arose out of the lower vertebrate types,
when we compare the different modes of their embryologic
development? How are we to estimate the chances for a
preservation of so much resemblance as exists between the
two in their embryologic lives, and the chances for the
variations that are observable? What we can safely conclude
is that there is a law which holds each species in a
constant repetition of its own fœtal growth, according to
its unvarying development in the same series of changes,
substitutions, or suppressions. But we can not safely conclude
that this species became formed in the supposed process
of descent from a remote ancestral stock, which may
or may not have originally exhibited the same series of
changes, substitutions, or suppressions. If the ancestors
of the mammalian vertebrates were the kind of animal
supposed, we have to find, in order to justify the supposed
descent, those states which represent the correspondence
between the mode in which the ancestral stock developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
its own embryos, when compared with the mode in which
the type of the lower vertebrata developed its embryos,
so as to make it reasonably certain that these subsidiary
organs derived their several substitutions or suppressions
from the process of descent, and not from any special mode
of development ordained for each distinct species. We
may imagine these states through which the mammalian
embryo has passed, but as yet we have only a theory which
suggests their existence without facts to support it. The
truth would seem to be that this whole subject of comparative
embryology, upon the hypothesis of the kinship of all
organized beings, or the descent of many distinct species
from a common stock, is involved in very great difficulties;
not the least of which is the difficulty of explaining how
the diverging descendants from that stock came to be
endowed with habits of embryologic life and growth that
resulted in the production of very different modes of development,
and at the same time preserved for each new
species its own peculiar mode of development. To say, for
example, that the mammalian embryo passed through states
representing, more or less distinctly, those which its remote
ancestors had in common with the lower vertebrata, and that
it developed certain subsidiary organs in like ways with the
lower vertebrata, is merely to state a theory, which, without
some evidence that the mammalian embryo was a formation
resulting from a connection of lives with lives back
to a common ancestor whose embryo was developed as those
of the lower vertebrata are, amounts to nothing. Often as
this want of evidence has been adverted to, it must be here
again pointed out: for the whole argument from embryology,
like that derived from a comparison of the forms of
mature animals, lacks the support of facts that are essential
to show the connection of life with life which descent from
a common ancestral stock necessarily implies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the hypothesis of the distinct crea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>tion
of different species deals with the phenomena of embryologic
life in a very different way. It supposes the
creation of a pair, male and female, and a law of procreation,
designed for the multiplication of individuals of a fixed
type. It supposes many such creations, each having in its
own peculiar germ the characteristic type of organism that
will distinguish the mature animal from all the others. It
supposes finally a law of development common to all the
species the individuals of which are multiplied by the sexual
union of male and female; a law of growth under like
conditions, which leads to a parallelism of development until
the typical plan of form and structure designed for each
distinct animal, and implanted in its germ, begins to take
on a mode of development peculiar to that species, and at
length the perfect individual of that species is the result.
In this hypothesis, therefore, there is no necessity for resorting
to any connection with an imaginary ancestral stock
of a different type, or for resorting to a theoretical process by
which successive generations may be supposed to have gradually
arisen out of the ancestral stock by successive changes
which have at length resulted in a totally new species.
The new species is what is supposed to have been aboriginally
created, and to have been placed under its own law
for the multiplication of individuals of the same type. In
point of simplicity, of comparative certainty, of freedom
from accidental causes of variation of which we can predicate
no specific result, this hypothesis seems to have a far
greater degree of probable evidence in its favor than the
theory which entirely lacks the requisite evidence of intermediate
connections between the lives of one species with
the lives of a remote and different species. For, while it
may be truly said that no man ever saw a special creation
take place, and while such an act of the infinite power is of
a nature that places it beyond the observation of our senses,
it is neither inconceivable nor improbable, nor inconsistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
with the idea of the divine attributes which we derive from
the study of nature. On the other hand, it is not only equally
true that no man ever saw, or in the nature of things ever
can see, an evolution of distinct species out of other distinct
species, but the whole nature of the supposed process of transformation
involves an element of chance which forbids all
calculation of the results. How, for example, in this very
matter of comparative embryological development on the
hypothesis of descent of all the species of the vertebrate animals
from a common ancestral stock of a different type, are
we to account for the fact that the embryo of any one of the
descended species has come to be developed in a mode
peculiar to itself and differing from the mode in which the
embryo of the ancestral stock was developed? The law of
sexual union, under which the individuals of the supposed
ancestral stock were multiplied, must have imposed on that
species an invincible necessity of reproducing in its offspring
the same type that constituted the peculiar organism
of the parents, whether these parents were or were not
the fittest survivors of their race after the severest struggle
for existence which they may have had to undergo. If the
pair, or the male of that pair, has in the course of that
struggle acquired a new organ, or more completely developed
an old one, before the act of procreation takes place,
how is it that the ovum is developed into the fœtus, and the
fœtus into the newly born infant, in an invariable mode
peculiar to the species to which the parents belonged?
Why did not the same causes of variation which are supposed
to have changed the ancestral type into one of a new
and entirely distinct character, also vary the mode of fœtal
development? When and how did the new organs become
fixed in the type which the parents have transmitted to the
offspring? And if they became so fixed in the germ which
was formed out of the cellular substance contributed by
each of the parents, why do we find in every known species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
participating in this process of reproduction a uniform
mode of embryologic development peculiar to the species,
and exhibiting its own suppressions and substitutions of
organs, irrespective of any newly acquired peculiarities in
the individual structures of the parents?</p>

<p>The believer in special creations has to answer no such
questions as these. His hypothesis assumes the creation of
a pair of animals of a certain distinct species; a law of procreation
and gestation common to a vast multitude of organisms;
and a law of embryologic growth peculiar to each
species. Whatever peculiarities of structure may have
been possessed by the immediate parents of any individual
of any one of these different species&mdash;peculiarities which
did not separate the parents from their race, but only made
them the fittest survivors of their race&mdash;those peculiarities
would or would not descend to their immediate offspring,
according to varying and very inappreciable circumstances.
But that which constituted the special type of the race,
and especially that which constituted its peculiar mode of
development during the embryonic stage, would remain unaffected
by these incidental and accidental peculiarities of
the parents, because, from all that we can discover, that
special type was impressed upon the embryo at the earliest
stage of its existence, and constituted the living model
that was to be developed into the perfect animal of that
species, by a law which placed it beyond the influence of
any adventitious and non-essential advantages which the
male or female parent may have acquired over other individuals
of the same race. So that, if the postulate of
a special creation of species be assumed as the groundwork
of the reasoning, we have to go through with no speculations
about a common ancestral stock of all the species,
and we have to account for no phenomena that are exposed
to chances which might have produced very different
results from those which are open to our observation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
and results of which we can predicate nothing with any degree
of certainty. On the hypothesis of the special creation
of a species, and an aboriginal pair of each species, with all
that this implies, we can with a high degree of certainty
predicate most of the phenomena that we have to observe,
and more especially so much of the phenomena of embryologic
growth of the different species as are open to our investigation
after the life of both mother and embryo has
become extinct.</p>

<p>It only remains for me to give to this reasoning a concrete
application. Take the case made use of by Mr. Spencer
in the passage above cited&mdash;that of the "allantois," a
vascular membrane, which is said to be in the mammalian
embryo homologous with one which in the higher oviparous
vertebrates, such as the birds and reptiles, replaces what
was at first a breathing apparatus, and becomes for them,
during the rest of embryonic life, a sort of lung, or an
organ that aërates the blood until the permanent respiratory
organs come into play. In the mammalian embryo, the
first appliance for aërating the blood is described as a system
of vessels distributed over the <i lang="la">area vasculosa</i>, and like that
which is first observable for the same purpose in fishes.
But, as the mammalian embryo continues to grow, a change
takes place. There buds out from it the vascular membrane
called the "allantois," which is substituted in the
place of the first aërating apparatus. Then a further
change takes place, as between the higher oviparous vertebrates
and the mammalian vertebrates. In the former, the
"allantois" continues to perform the breathing function
through the rest of the embryonic life. In the mammalian
vertebrates it undergoes two changes: In the implacental
mammals, it aborts, having no function to discharge; in the
placental mammals it becomes modified into another organ,
namely, that which serves to convey nutrition from the
mother to the offspring. After birth, it is of course ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the reasoning, or rather the assertion, that these
substitutions are unaccountable as the results of design,
appears to me to be singularly inconclusive. It is quite
illogical, according to all philosophic meaning of design as
applied to the works of the Creator, or to the works of nature,
if that term is preferred, to argue that a particular
object could have been better accomplished directly, than
by a metamorphosis of an organ from one function to
another, or by substitution. The metamorphosis, or substitution,
which in such cases we find in nature, is of itself the
very highest evidence that the indirect method was the
best, if we admit the idea of a Creator, because it was the
method chosen by a being of infinite perfections for reasons
which we may not be able to discover, but which we must
presume to have existed, if we concede that hypothesis of
attributes which "design" in this case necessarily implies.
But how are these metamorphoses and substitutions any
more accountable upon the supposition that the mammalian
type arose by generation out of the lower vertebrate types
which in their embryonic life exhibited the same changes?
The doctrine or theory of evolution does not account for
them at all; for, while the doctrine supposes, as matters of
pure theory, that there were certain states through which
the mammalian embryo passed, which represented more or
less distinctly those which it had in common with its assumed
remote ancestors, the lower vertebrata, it does
nothing more than to suggest the theoretical idea that the
mammalian embryo came to develop these subsidiary organs
in the mode in which they were developed in the embryo
of the lower vertebrata, because it was descended from the
lower vertebrata. The varying states through which the
embryo passed from the lower vertebrata to the mammalian
type, are all hypothetical, and there is, therefore, no basis
of fact on which to rest the belief in a common mode of
development, as resulting from a connection of lives with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
lives between the mammalian type and the types of birds,
reptiles, or fishes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the hypothesis of the special creation
of a species implies the simple fact of a designed process of
embryonic development for each species, with substitutions
of organs and changes of function in certain organs peculiar
to that species; a fact which may well consist in a certain
parallelism in the different metamorphoses, and a preservation
of the same unvarying changes in the development of
each separate embryo. Why these changes should exist, we
can not tell; but their existence is very strong proof that
they were designed, or made to take place, for some reason,
if we admit the hypothesis of a Creator. For that hypothesis,
we must look to a wider class of facts, and to the whole
phenomena of nature.</p>

<p>4. We now come to the argument from distribution.
This is one of the weakest of the indirect supports of the
doctrine of evolution; but, as it is much relied upon, it
must be stated with all the force that it is supposed to
have. The facts that are relied upon are these: When we
survey the whole surface of the globe, so far as it is known
to us, we find, in the first place, that the areas which have
similar conditions (of soil and climate), and sometimes,
where the areas are nearly adjacent, are occupied by quite
different faunas. On the other hand, it is said that areas
remote from each other in latitude, and contrasted in soil
and climate, are occupied by closely allied faunas. The
inference drawn is, that there is no manifest predetermined
adaptation of the organisms to the areas, or habitats, in
which they are found, because we do not find that like organisms
are universally or generally found in like habitats,
nor very unlike organisms in very unlike habitats. The
conclusion is, that the facts of distribution in space do not
conform to the hypothesis of design. In other words, the
different animals found in different regions were not spe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>cially
designed for those regions, but some of them have
extended into regions of a different character; and when
the regions are very unlike there are not found very unlike
organisms, but there is a general similarity, or a less extensive
variety. There is said, also, to be another important
fact, namely, that "the similar areas peopled by dissimilar
forms are those between which there are impassable barriers;
while the dissimilar areas peopled by similar forms,
are those between which there are no such barriers."
Hence is drawn the conclusion that "each species of organism
tends ever to expand its sphere of existence&mdash;to intrude
on other areas, other modes of life, other media."<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> A
good deal of aid is supposed to be derived for this argument
respecting animal life by analogies drawn from the vegetable
kingdom; but I can not help thinking that there is
much caution to be observed in formulating such analogies
into a law of universal application, or into one that relates
to the existence of animal organisms. The origin, the
multiplication, and the spread of animals involve a principle
of life, organization and development which is very different
in some important respects from that which obtains
in the vegetable world. But, without laying any stress
upon this distinction, and without intending to deprive
the argument for animal evolution of any aid which it can
derive from such supposed analogies, I pass to the specific
argument respecting animal distribution. The argument
is this: Races of organisms become distributed over different
areas, and also through different media. They are
thrust by the pressure of overpopulation from their old
into new habitats, and as they diverge more widely in
space they undergo more and more modifications of structure,
by reason of the new conditions on which they enter.
Thus, these powerfully incident forces, the new conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
on which the migrating races enter in new regions, vary
the structure which they originally brought with them, and
which descended to them from the common stock of which
they were modified descendants. The widest divergences
in space, under such circumstances, will indicate the longest
periods of time during which these various descendants
from a common stock have been subject to modifying conditions.
There will, therefore, come to be, it is said,
among organisms of the same group, smaller contrasts of
structure in the smaller areas; and, where the varying incident
forces vary greatly within given areas, the alterations
will become more numerous than in equal areas which are
less variously conditioned: that is to say, in the most uniform
regions there will be the fewest species, and in the
most multiform regions there will be the most numerous
species. These hypotheses are said to be in accordance
with the facts of distribution in space.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>But there are also facts of distribution through different
media. The meaning of this is, that, whereas all forms
of organisms have descended from some primordial simplest
form, which inhabited some one medium, such as the water,
its descendants, by migration into some other medium or
other media, underwent adaptations to media quite unlike
the original medium. In other words, the earth and the
air have been colonized from the water. Numerous facts
are adduced in support of this conclusion, which are thus
summarized:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are particular habitats in which animals are subject to
changes of media. In such habitats exist animals having, in various
degrees, the power to live in both media, consequent on various
phases of transitional organization. Near akin to these animals,
there are some that, after passing their early lives in the water,
acquire more completely the structures fitting them to live on land,
to which they then migrate. Lastly, we have closely-allied creat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>ures
like the Surinam toad and the terrestrial salamander, which,
though they belong by their structures to the class Amphibia, are
not amphibious in their habits&mdash;creatures the larvæ of which do
not pass their early lives in the water, and yet go through these same
metamorphoses! Must we, then, think that the distribution of kindred
organisms through different media presents an insurmountable
difficulty? On the contrary, with facts like these before us, the evolution-hypothesis
supplies possible interpretations of many phenomena
that are else unaccountable. Realizing the way in which such
changes of media are in some cases gradually imposed by physical
conditions, and in other cases voluntarily commenced and slowly
increased in the search after food, we shall begin to understand
how, in the course of evolution, there have arisen those strange
obscurations of one type by the externals of another type. When
we see land-birds occasionally feeding by the water-side, and then
learn that one of them, the water-ouzel, an "anomalous member of
the strictly terrestrial thrush family, wholly subsists by diving&mdash;grasping
the stones with its feet and using its wings under water"&mdash;we
are enabled to comprehend how, under pressure of population,
aquatic habits may be acquired by creatures organized for aërial
life; and how there may eventually arise an ornithic type, in which
the traits of the bird are very much disguised.</p>

<p>Finding among mammals some that, in search of prey or shelter,
have taken to the water in various degrees, we shall cease to be
perplexed on discovering the mammalian structure hidden under a
fish-like form, as it is in the Cetacea. Grant that there has even
been going on that redistribution of organisms which we see still
resulting from their intrusions on one another's areas, media, and
modes of life, and we have an explanation of those multitudinous
cases in which homologies of structure are complicated with analogies.
And while it accounts for the occurrence, in one medium of organic
types fundamentally organized for another medium, the doctrine
of evolution accounts also for the accompanying unfitness. Either the
seal has descended from some mammal which, little by little, became
aquatic in its habits, in which case the structure of its hind-limbs has
a meaning; or else it was specially framed for its present habitat,
in which case the structure of its hind-limbs is incomprehensible.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>Along with these phenomena of distribution in space
and in medium of life, we have the further element of distribution
in time; the facts of which are admitted, however,
to be too fragmentary to be conclusive either for or
against the doctrine of evolution. Still it is claimed that
there is one general truth respecting distribution in time,
which is "profoundly significant, namely, that the relations
between the extinct forms of life, found by geological
exploration, and the present forms of life, especially in each
great geographical region, show in the aggregate a close
kinship, and a connection which is in perfect harmony with
the belief in evolution, but quite irreconcilable with any
other belief. As Mr. Darwin has expressed it, there is 'a
wonderful relationship in the same continent between the
living and the dead.'"<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The argument from distribution is thus summed up by
Mr. Spencer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Given, then, that pressure which species exercise on one another,
in consequence of the universal overfilling of their respective habitats&mdash;given
the resulting tendency to thrust themselves into one
another's areas, and media, and modes of life, along such lines of
least resistance as from time to time are found&mdash;given, besides the
changes in modes of life hence arising, those other changes which
physical alterations of habitats necessitate&mdash;given the structural
modifications directly or indirectly produced in organisms by modified
conditions&mdash;and the facts of distribution in space and time are
accounted for. That divergence and redivergence of organic forms,
which we saw to be shadowed forth by the truths of classification
and the truths of embryology, we see to be also shadowed forth by
the truths of distribution. If that aptitude to multiply, to spread,
to separate, and to differentiate, which the human races have in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
times shown, be a tendency common to races in general, as we have
ample reason to assume, then there will result that kind of relation
among the species, and genera, and orders, peopling the earth's
surface, which we find exists. Those remarkable identities of type
discovered between organisms inhabiting one medium, and strangely-modified
organisms inhabiting another medium, are at the same time
rendered comprehensible. And the appearances and disappearances
of species which the geological record shows us, as well as the connections
between successive groups of species from early eras down
to our own, cease to be inexplicable.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Passing by what is here said of the aptitude of the human
race to multiply, to spread, to separate, and to differentiate&mdash;an
aptitude which has never resulted in the production
of an essentially different animal, or in anything but
incidental variations within the limits of the same species&mdash;I
propose now to apply to this argument from distribution
a test which seems to me to be a perfectly fair one, and one
which it ought to be able to encounter. If the theory that
the different species of animals now known to us have been
evolved successively by descent from some primordial simplest
form through modifications induced by change of
habitation, of medium of life, and accumulation of new
structures occurring through an immense period of time,
be a sound hypothesis, the process which has evolved superior
out of inferior organizations ought, in consistency with
itself and with all its supposed conditions, to be capable of
being reversed, so as to lead to the evolution of inferior out
of superior organisms. For, although the doctrine of evolution
has thus far been applied only to facts which are
supposed to show an ascent in the scale of being, the argument
ought to be equally good for a descent in the scale of
being, provided we take care to include all the elements and
causes of a change of structure, mode and medium of life,
and the necessary element of time, in the operation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
process. The imaginary case that is about to be put shall
include all the elements of the evolutionary hypothesis,
and will serve to test at least the rationality of that theory.</p>

<p>Let it be supposed, then, that there was a period in the
history of this earth when the whole human race, however
it originated, was confined to an island, thousands of miles
from any other land. This race of men adapted to a life
in one medium, the air, may be supposed to have so far
advanced in the ruder arts of hunting and fishing, and in
the higher art of tillage, as to be able for many generations
to support life by what the sea and the land would put
within their reach, and by the product which their rude
agriculture could extract from the soil, or which the soil
would spontaneously yield. But as the centuries flow on,
the population begins to press upon the resources of the territory,
and the struggle for life becomes very great. At
length a point is reached where the supply of food from
the land becomes inadequate to sustain the population,
and what can be made up from the sea will not supply the
deficiency. The population will then slowly decrease, but,
while this decrease goes on, there comes in a disturbing
cause which will prevent any adjustment of the supply of
food to the diminished number of the consumers. The
sea begins by almost imperceptible but steadily progressing
encroachments to diminish the area of dry land; a change
of climate reduces the number of other animals available
for human food, and reduces the productive capacity of the
earth. Then ensues that struggle for existence which is
supposed to entail changes of medium of life, and to induce
transformations of structure. The conditions of existence
have become wholly changed. The wretched descendants
of a once comparatively thriving race are dwelling on a
territory which has become a marsh. They have no means
of migrating to another territory; they can only migrate
to another medium. They begin by feeding exclusively on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
what the water will afford. They pass their lives in the
pursuit of a prey which lives only in the water, and in this
change of life they acquire or develop organs adapted to
the new condition, organs which, in such miserable reproduction
of their own species as can go on, they transmit to
their offspring. Modifications upon modifications accumulate
in this way through untold periods of time, until at
last a new aquatic or a new amphibious creature is formed,
and the difference between that creature and his remote
ancestral human stock is as great as that between man
and the seal, or between man and any fish that swims.
Still, there will be peculiarities of structure retained, which
might lead any inhabitant of another world, alighting on
this globe and undertaking to trace the origin of this new
creature, to the supposition that he was akin to a race of
men whose fossil remains he might find buried in some
stratum beneath the marsh which was the last habitat of
this unfortunate race, when it had all the characteristics of
its original type.</p>

<p>Is it conceivable that this transformation could take
place? Could such a condition and situation result in anything
but the utter extinction of the human race, or, in
other words, in an absolute break? Could there be any
modifications exhibited by the last survivors of that race
other than those which are familiar to us among the varieties
of the human species which have never separated themselves
from their race, and between whom and their ancestral
stock, wherever it was originally placed on this globe, we
recognize no fundamental difference of structure, whatever
may have been the changes of habitat or conditions of life?
Yet the conditions and elements of this imaginary case, which
is simply the process of evolution reversed, are just what the
evolution theory assumes as the causes of that modification
which proceeds from a lower to a higher organism; and
whatever may be said of the tendency, through "the sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>vival
of the fittest," to evolve higher out of lower forms of
animal life, if we allow time enough for the process, there
is no reason, in the nature of things, why corresponding
conditions should not lead to a degradation as well as to
an elevation in the scale of beings. There is, however, one
reason why no such potency should be ascribed to the conditions,
either in respect to the one result or the other.
That reason is that all such causes of modification, either
in the ascending or the descending scale, are so limited in
their effects that distinct beings can not be rationally
predicated as their product, whereas the power of the Infinite
Artificer to give existence to distinct beings is absolutely
without limit. If naturalists would turn their attention
to the limitations upon the power of all such causes as
those which are supposed to work in the process of evolution,
and would give us the explanations to which those
limitations point, in those cases of local variation which
are exhibited by animals that can clearly be traced to a
parent form, they would not be compelled to resort to a
sweeping theory that refuses all force to any hypothesis but
its own.</p>

<p>But now let us go a step further in this imaginary case.
Let us suppose that after this new creature, fish or amphibian,
descended from the human race, has inhabited the
water surrounding the ill-fated island for a million of years,
another great change takes place. The water begins to recede
from the land by gradations as slow as those by which
in the former period it encroached. The land rises from the
low level to which it had sunk, by volcanic action. Forests
spring up upon the sides of mountains. The soil becomes
firm; verdure overspreads the fields; the climate grows
genial; the wilderness blossoms as the rose. Allow another
million years for this restoration of the territory to an inhabitable
condition. Slowly and in an unbroken series of generations
the aquatic creatures, descended from the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
human inhabitants of the island, emerge from the sea and
betake themselves to the land. Modifications upon modifications
accumulate, new organs are acquired; the survival
of the fittest perpetuates them; the animals ascend in the
scale of being, until the human type is again evolved out
of the degraded descendants of the population which two
millions of years previously dwelt as men upon the island,
and carried on in some primitive fashion the simpler arts
of human life. Is not this just as supposable as the evolution
of the human race out of some lower form of organism?
Are not all the elements&mdash;time, migration from one
medium to another, change of conditions, and what is supposed
to lead to the production of different organisms&mdash;just
as powerful to produce the inferior out of the superior
as to produce the superior out of the inferior, and so on
interchangeably? The answer in each case is, that all such
causes of modification in the animal kingdom are limited;
that when once a distinct species is in existence, we have
no evidence that it loses its distinct type or merges itself in
another, although the earth may be full of evidence that
types which formerly existed are no longer among the living
organisms.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>
</div>


<p class="intro">Mr. Spencer's agnosticism&mdash;His theory of the origin of religious beliefs&mdash;The
mode in which mankind are to lose the consciousness of a personal
God.</p>


<p>In a former chapter I had occasion to advert to one of
Mr. Spencer's favorite dogmas, namely, the impossibility of
an intellectual conception of creation, which he thinks is
made apparent by the statement that one term of the relation,
the thing created, is something, and the other term of
the relation, that out of which the thing was created, is
nothing. When I wrote the chapter in which I commented
on this extraordinary kind of logic, I felt a little disposed to
apologize to my readers for answering it. I had not then
met with the fuller statement of Mr. Spencer's peculiar
agnosticism which I am now about to quote. The controversy
recently carried on between Mr. Spencer and Mr.
Harrison was closed by the former in an article entitled
"Last Words about Agnosticism and the Religion of Humanity,"
which appeared in the "Nineteenth Century" for November,
1884. This drew my attention to a passage in Mr.
Spencer's "Essays," which he has reproduced in his late article
for the purpose of repeating his position against some of
the misrepresentations which he complains had been made
of it by Mr. Harrison. I have nothing to do with the controversy
between these two gentlemen, or with any of the
arguments which Mr. Spencer's opponents, be they churchmen
or laymen, have employed against him. I take the
passage as he has quoted it from his "Essays," for the pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>pose
of making his agnostic views the subject of a more
extended commentary than I had bestowed on them in my
previous chapter, in writing which I had before me only a
passage contained in his "Biology." There is no occasion,
however, for altering a word of what I had previously written;
for, on a comparison of his position as given in the
"Biology," and that given in the "Essays," it appears very
plainly that I had not misunderstood him. But as the
passage in the "Essays" displays much more fully the peculiar
reasoning by which he supports his agnostic philosophy,
I should not do justice to him or to my readers if I
did not notice it. The passage is the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Always implying terms in relation, thought implies that both
terms shall be more or less defined; and as fast as one of them becomes
indefinite, the relation also becomes indefinite, and thought
becomes indistinct. Take the case of magnitudes. I think of an
inch; I think of a foot; and having tolerably definite ideas of the
two, I have a tolerably definite idea of the relation between them.
I substitute for the foot a mile; and being able to represent a mile
much less definitely, I can not so definitely think of the relation between
an inch and a mile&mdash;can not distinguish it in thought from the
relation between an inch and two miles, as clearly as I can distinguish
in thought the relation between an inch and one foot from
the relation between an inch and two feet. And now, if I endeavor
to think of the relation between an inch and the 240,000 miles
from here to the moon, or the relation between an inch and the
92,000,000 miles from here to the sun, I find that while these distances,
practically inconceivable, have become little more than
numbers to which I frame no answering ideas, so too has the relation
between an inch and either of them become practically inconceivable.
Now this partial failure in the process of forming
thought relations, which happens even with finite magnitudes when
one of them is immense, passes into complete failure when one of
them can not be brought within any limits. The relation itself
becomes unrepresentable at the same time that one of its terms
becomes unrepresentable. Nevertheless, in this case it is to be
observed that the almost blank form of relation preserves a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
qualitative character. It is still distinguishable as belonging to the
consciousness of extensions, not to the consciousnesses of forces
or durations; and in so far remains a vaguely identifiable relation.
But now suppose we ask what happens when one term of the relation
has not simply magnitude having no known limits, and duration
of which neither beginning nor end is cognizable, but is also
an existence not to be defined? In other words, what must happen
if one term of the relation is not only quantitatively but also
qualitatively unrepresentable? Clearly in this case the relation
does not simply cease to be thinkable except as a relation of a certain
class, but it lapses completely. When one of the terms becomes
wholly unknowable, the law of thought can no longer be
conformed to; both because one term can not be present, and because
relation itself can not be framed ... In brief, then, to Mr.
Martineau's objection I reply that the insoluble difficulties he indicates
arise here, as elsewhere, when thought is applied to that
which transcends the sphere of thought; and that just as when we
try to pass beyond phenomenal manifestations to the Ultimate Reality
manifested, we have to symbolize it out of such materials as
the phenomenal manifestations give us; so we have simultaneously
to symbolize the connection between this Ultimate Reality and its
manifestations, as somehow allied to the connections among the
phenomenal manifestations themselves. The truth Mr. Martineau's
criticism adumbrates is that the law of thought fails where the elements
of thought fail; and this is a conclusion quite conformable
to the general view I defend. Still holding the validity of my argument
against Hamilton and Mansel, that in pursuance of their
own principle the Relative is not at all thinkable <em>as such</em>, unless in
contradiction to some existence posited, however vaguely, as the
other term of a relation, conceived however indefinitely; it is
consistent on my part to hold that in this effort which thought
inevitably makes to pass beyond its sphere, not only does the
product of thought become a dim symbol of a product, but the
process of thought becomes a dim symbol of a process; and hence
any predicament inferable from the law of thought can not be
asserted.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>In judging of the soundness of this reasoning, the first
thing to be done is to determine what we are thinking
about when we compare the finite with the infinite, or
when, to put it as Mr. Spencer does, we have two terms of
a relation, one of which is a thing open to the observation
of our senses, and the other of which lies beyond them.
In this case, does all thinkable relation lapse, or fade into
an impossible conception, when we undertake to conceive
of that which lies beyond what we see? Does the relation
between the two supposed terms cease to be a continuously
existing relation? Or, to quote Mr. Spencer's words, is it
true that "insoluble difficulties arise, because thought is
applied to that which is beyond the sphere of thought"?</p>

<p>We must be careful to distinguish between the "insoluble
difficulties" which arise out of the imperfection of
language adequate to give a formal description of a thing,
and which may lead us to suppose ourselves involved in
contradictions, and the "insoluble difficulties" which may
arise out of the impossibility of having a mental representation
of that thing. The latter is the only difficulty
about which we need concern ourselves; and the best way
to test the supposed difficulty as an insuperable one is to
take one of the illustrations used by Mr. Spencer&mdash;the idea
of space. We measure a foot or a mile of space, and then
compare it with the idea of endless or (to us) immeasurable
space. Figures afford us the means of expressing in language
a certain definite number of miles of space, but,
beyond the highest figures of which we have definite forms
of expression, we can not go in definite descriptions of
space. But when we have exhausted all the expressions of
number that our arithmetical forms of expression admit,
does it follow that we can not conceive of extension beyond
that number? On the contrary, the very measure which
we are able to express in figures, to a certain extent, in regard
both to space and time, gives us the idea of space and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
time, and shows us that there must be an extension of both
beyond and forever beyond the portion of either which language
will allow us definitely to describe. This to us immeasurable
and indescribable extent of space or time becomes
a thinkable idea, because we are all the while thinking
of space or time, whether it is a measurable portion of
either, or an immeasurable and endless existence.</p>

<p>Take as another illustration a purely moral idea. We
know that there is a moral quality which we call goodness;
an attribute of human character of which we have a clear
conception, and which we can describe because it is manifested
to us in human lives. When we speak of the moral
phenomena to which we give the name of goodness, or virtue,
all mankind know what is meant. But human virtue
is imperfect, limited, measurable. It may be idealized into
something approaching to perfection, but the ideal character
thus drawn must fall short of perfection if it is made
consistent with human nature. But from human character
we derive the idea of goodness or virtue as a thinkable idea.
Is the idea of absolute perfection of this quality any less
thinkable? Absolute perfection of moral character can not
be described by a definition; but, as we know that a measurable
goodness which we can describe exists, wherein consists
the failure or lapse of a thinkable relation, when we
reason from that which exists in a measurable degree to
that which transcends all degree? We are all the while
thinking of goodness or virtue, whether we think of it as
limited and imperfect, or as unlimited and perfect. Take
another quality&mdash;power. We know that there is such a
quality as power, wielded by human beings, and guided by
their will. But human power is limited, measurable, and
therefore finite. When we reason from the finite power of
man to the idea of an infinite and immeasurable power
held and wielded by another being, do we strive to conceive
of something that is unthinkable because we can only say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
that the power of that other being is without limit? We
are all the while thinking of power, of the quality of power,
whether we think of it as measurable or immeasurable.
All qualities and all faculties which are manifested to us in
a limited degree, when we conceive of them as unlimited
and without degree, become proofs that what exists in a
measurable and limited degree may exist without limitation
and without degree. Although we can only define the
finite, the infinite is not the less a subject of true thinking,
because, whether we think of the finite or the infinite, what
we are all the time thinking about is the quality of power,
and nothing else. In the one case it is limited, in the
other it is unlimited, but it is all the time the quality itself
of which we are thinking.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>But now let us attend a little more closely to Mr. Spencer's
grand objection to this mode of thinking. The
reader will be careful to note that what he needs to ascertain
is, whether Mr. Spencer's agnostic theory is really
sound. To test it, he must inquire just where the supposed
difficulty lies. Translated into other language, Mr.
Spencer's position is this: In order to keep within the
sphere of possible thought, there must be a definite relation
between any two ideas, which must not lapse, but the two
ideas must be equally capable of mental representation.
When one term of the relation is an idea capable of mental
representation, as when we think of a thing cognizable by
our senses, and the other term of the relation is something
that lies beyond them, the law of thought, according to
Mr. Spencer, can no longer be conformed to; the relation
lapses; the latter term can not be present to the mind;
we pass out of the sphere of thought into that which can
not be a subject of thought, the unknown and the unknow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>able.
What takes place in this process is assumed to be
this: We take certain phenomenal manifestations which
we are able to observe and to describe. Out of the materials
which these phenomenal manifestations give us, we "symbolize
the Ultimate Reality." We do this, by arguing
from the phenomenal manifestations which convince us of
the existence of a being whom we know and can observe,
to the existence of a being in whom we "symbolize" qualities
and faculties which the phenomenal manifestations
show us to belong to human beings. At the same time we
represent to ourselves by the same symbolizing process a
connection between the Ultimate Reality and its manifestation,
which is allied to the connections among the phenomenal
manifestations which we observe in man, or in
nature. In other words, we reason from what we see and
can measure and describe, to that which we can not see or
describe, and we end in a term of the relation which can
not be present to the mind, and thus no thinkable relation
can be framed.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said of the rational force of the evidence
derived from phenomenal manifestations which we
can observe when we reason about other phenomenal manifestations
which we can not measure, it can not be said
that we have reached a term in the relation that is beyond
the sphere of thought. What I understand Mr. Spencer
to mean when he speaks of "symbolizing" out of the
materials which the phenomenal manifestations give us,
may be a process liable to error, but it does not involve or
lead to the "insoluble difficulties" that are supposed to
arise. For example, when, from the existence and power
of man, a being whom we know, and whose phenomenal
manifestations lead us to a knowledge of his limited faculties,
we reason to the existence of a being whose faculties
are boundless, we may be in danger of conclusions into
which imperfection will find its way; but it certainly is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
not true that in thinking of unlimited power or goodness,
or any other unlimited quality, we transcend the sphere of
thought. When we have expressed in figures the greatest
measurable idea of space that can be so expressed, what do
we "symbolize," when we say that beyond that measured
space there stretches a space that we can not measure, and
to which there is of necessity no limit? Does a thinkable
relation cease to exist, because one of the terms is immeasurable
to us? As soon as we have formed an idea of a
measurable portion of space, we necessarily have an idea of
endless and immeasurable space; and in this deduction we
have employed no "symbol" formed out of the materials
which the measurable manifestations have given us. We
have simply reached a conclusion that is inevitable. We are
all the while thinking of space, whether it is definite space
that we can measure, or indefinite space that we can not
measure.</p>

<p>When the moral and intellectual qualities of men constitute
one part of the phenomenal manifestations which
we adopt as the basis of reasoning to the existence of God,
we are in danger of assigning to that being attributes of
character which would be far from perfection. Nearly all
the religions that have existed, and of which we have much
knowledge&mdash;perhaps all of them but one&mdash;have displayed
more or less of this tendency. It is only necessary to instance
the Hebrew Scriptures, for there are parts of that
narrative in which the Deity is represented as actuated by
something very much like human passions and motives,
and these representations are among the hardest things to
be reconciled with the idea that those books were inspired
writings. Every one knows with what effect these passages
of the Hebrew Scriptures are used by those who reject both
the Old and the New Testaments as inspired books. But
is philosophy therefore to shrink from the use of materials
with which the world is filled, and which lead to the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ception
of a being of infinite faculties and perfect goodness?
Grant all that may be said of the stupid and fatal
errors into which men have been led by likening the Deity
to man: there remains a vast store-house of materials on
which to reason to the existence of God, which philosophy
can not afford to reject, which can be freed from the peril
that has often attended their use, and which involve no
"symbolizing" process of the kind which Mr. Spencer
imagines.</p>

<p>Let us again translate Mr. Spencer's language, and endeavor
to analyze his position. There is, he says, a law of
thought, which requires and depends upon certain elements
of thought. By "thought" he means a conceivable idea,
or one which the mind can represent to itself. By the elements
of thought he means, I suppose, the data which
enable us to have an idea of a product. The process of
reaching this product is supposed to be conducted according
to a law which requires us to have the data or elements
by which the process is to be conducted. For example, in
the process of reaching an idea of definite space as a product
of thought, we take certain data or elements, by conceiving
of space as divided into successive portions to which
we give the name of feet or miles. The product of thought
is the number of feet or miles into which we divide the
definite space of which we form an idea. In this process
we have conformed to Mr. Spencer's law of thought, because
we have data or elements by which to conduct the
process and reach the product.</p>

<p>But now, says Mr. Spencer, when thought undertakes
to have as its product the idea of endless space, it makes
an effort to pass beyond its sphere; the elements of thought
fail, and therefore the law of thought fails; the product
is nothing but a dim symbol of a product; the process
becomes nothing but a dim symbol of a process; and no
predicament, that is, no fact, is here inferable from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
law of thought as a fact or predicament that can be asserted.
But what, in the case supposed, is the fact or predicament
that is asserted, when we speak or think of endless space,
or of space that transcends all our powers of measurement?
Is it correct to say that the law of thought fails, because
we can not express endless space in feet or miles? Is it
true that we have only "symbolized" the product of endless
space out of the data or elements of measurable space?
Here it is necessary to inquire what the learned philosopher
means by "symbolizing" a product or a process. I understand
him to mean, in the case supposed, that whereas in
reference to the idea or product of a measurable space we
have certain data or elements out of which to form that
idea, when we undertake to think of endless space we
transfer the notion of a measurable space to that of which
no measure can be predicated, and therefore we can have
no conception of endless space, but only a "formless consciousness
of the inscrutable." Let us see if this is sound.</p>

<p>Take as a convenient idea of a measurable space the
92,000,000 miles from the earth to the sun, and lay it down
on paper. If, after having measured this space, we could
transport ourselves to the sun, we could extend the line in
the same direction beyond the sun, by laying down a further
measurement of 92,000,000 miles from the sun to any
object that we could observe beyond the sun. This process
we could repeat indefinitely and forever, if we could be
successively removed to the different stages at each point
of departure. But when an aggregate of such multiplied
measurements had been reached greater than could be expressed
in figures, we should still have the intellectual power
of thinking of an extension of space indefinitely beyond
that which we have measured. Nothing would have failed
us but the power of expressing in figures the endless extent
of space which lies beyond the utmost limit that we can
so express.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>It is precisely here, as I suppose, that Mr. Spencer's
"symbolizing process" and his "symbolized product"
come in. We have taken as the elements of thought the
idea of successive measurements of space; and the law of
thought permits us to have as a definite product whatever
extent of space can be marked off by such successive
measurements. But when we undertake to have, as the
product of thought, a consciousness, or conception, of endless
space, we have merely used the idea of a definite space
as a "symbol," or <em>simulacrum</em>, of that which is without
form, and is only a "formless consciousness of the inscrutable"&mdash;whatever
that means.</p>

<p>Let us see what has happened. The power of measuring,
or describing in form, a definite extent of space, has
given us an idea of space. The product of our thought is
extension between two given points. Such extensions must
be capable of indefinite multiplication, although we can not
express in figures an indefinite multiplicand. The product
is then something beyond what we can express in a definite
form; but is it beyond the sphere of thought? What is
it? It is an idea which we deduce by a strict process of
reasoning, and to which we do not need to give and can not
give expression in figures. The process of reasoning is this:
Measurement has given us an idea of space; our faculty
of applying measurement is limited; but our faculty of
conceiving of space through which we could go on forever
multiplying such measurements, if we had the means, is
certainly a faculty of which all men are conscious who are
accustomed to analyze the processes of thought. In this
process we may reach that which in one sense is "inscrutable."
It is inscrutable, inasmuch as we can not understand
how eternity of space or time came to exist. Our
experience of phenomena enables us to have an idea of
space and time, and from the fact that we have measured
off portions of space or time, we deduce the fact that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
must be an eternity of both. It is immaterial whether we
call this a "symbolizing" process, or call it something else.
The product is an idea at which we arrive by a strict process
of reasoning. Eternity of space or time is an inscrutable
idea, when we attempt to inquire how it came to be.
That it exists, is an idea from which the human mind can
not escape, and which it reaches by a perfectly sound deduction.
We are all the while thinking of space or time,
whether we are thinking of that which is measurable, or of
that which is immeasurable.</p>

<p>I now come to a passage in Mr. Spencer's recent article
which it is necessary to attempt to explain to the unlearned
reader, and to bring it, if possible, within the reach of
ordinary minds. This passage, which follows in his recent
article immediately after his quotation from his "Essays,"
is the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus, then, criticisms like this of Mr. Martineau, often recurring
in one shape or other, and now again made by Mr. Harrison, do not
show the invalidity of my argument, but once more show the
imbecility of human intelligence when brought to bear on the ultimate
question. Phenomenon without noumenon is unthinkable;
and yet noumenon can not be thought of in the true sense of thinking.
We are at once obliged to be conscious of a reality behind
appearance, and yet can neither bring this consciousness of reality
into any shape, nor can bring into any shape its connection with
appearance. The forms of our thought, molded on experience of
phenomena, as well as the connotations of our words formed to express
the relations of phenomena, involve us in contradictions when
we try to think of that which is beyond phenomena; and yet the
existence of that which is beyond phenomena is a necessary datum
alike of our thoughts and our words. We have no choice but to
accept a formless consciousness of the inscrutable.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some definitions must now be given. The word "phenomenon"
has become naturalized in our English tongue.
Derived as a noun from the Greek verb Φαίνομαι, <em>to appear</em>,
it means anything visible; whatever is presented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the eye by observation or experiment, or what is discovered
to exist; as the phenomena of the natural world, the
phenomena of the heavenly bodies, of terrestrial substances,
the phenomena of heat and color.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In this application the
word denotes what appears to us, or what we discover by
our senses. It is also used, in the plural, more loosely, to
denote occurrences or things which we observe to happen;
as when, speaking of physical occurrences, we mean physical
facts the happening of which we observe. Moral phenomena,
on the other hand, are the appearances exhibited
by the action of mind.</p>

<p>The word <em>noumenon</em> has not become naturalized in our
language, and did not exist in Greek.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> It can convey no
intelligible meaning to common readers without tracing its
derivation, and when it is analyzed we can attribute to it
no meaning but a purely arbitrary one, even if we can
arrive at that arbitrary signification. In fact, it is a word
made by and for the school of Kant. Its first syllable is
the Greek noun νοῦς or νόος, which corresponds to our
English word <em>thought</em> or <em>intelligence</em>. The Greek verb
νοέω, <em>to think</em>, was primarily used as <em>I perceive</em>; the act of
the mind in seeing. This idea was distinct from εἴδω,
which conveyed the plain meaning of I <em>see</em>. But so subtile
were the Greeks in their use of words, that εἴδω was sometimes
used specifically to mean <em>to see with the mind's eye</em>,
or, as we sometimes say, to <em>realize</em>, or to have a mental
perception of. In the Greek use of the two words νοεω and
εἴδω, no distinction was made between <em>phenomenon</em> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
<em>noumenon</em>. To a cultivated Greek, <em>phenomenon</em> would
mean something perceived, and <em>noumenon</em>, if he had possessed
the word, would have had the same meaning. He
would have used the two words interchangeably, to express
either sight by the visual organs or mental perception. Mr.
Spencer uses them as if they meant different things, as if
<em>phenomenon</em> were something different from <em>noumenon</em>.
But <em>noumenon</em>, according to its derivation (for it is coined
as the participle of nοεων), means a thing, subject, or object,
<em>perceived by the mind</em>. The root idea is mind-action, the
verb νοεω meaning to do what the mind does in apprehending
a subject or object. So that the derivation of <em>noumenon</em>
does not help us to understand the Kantian or Spencerian
use of the word.</p>

<p>As this use of the word is, then, purely arbitrary, we
must try to understand, as well as we can, what this arbitrary
meaning is. As well as I can fathom it, in contrast
with <em>phenomenon</em>, the meaning is that <em>phenomenon</em> is something
that we see, and <em>noumenon</em> is the ghost or double
of what we see. We see a thing with our eyes; but our
mind does not see it&mdash;it perceives its ghostly double. This
is <em>noumenon</em>.</p>

<p>Penetrating, or trying to penetrate, a little further into
Mr. Spencer's meaning, it would seem that when he says
that <em>phenomenon</em> without <em>noumenon</em> is unthinkable, he
means that, although we can see a thing with our corporeal
eye, we can not think of it without the mental act of seeing
its image with the mind's eye; and then he adds that
<em>noumenon</em> can not be thought of in the true sense of thinking,
because <em>noumenon</em> is an abstraction or a mere ghost of
a subject or an object.</p>

<p>What is all this but a kind of play upon words? We
are so constituted that the impressions which a thing external
to us produces upon our nerves of perception are
instantly transmitted to the brain, and the mind has an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>stantaneous
perception of that object. The phenomenon
which we see with our eyes, or become sensible of by touch,
thus becomes a thing perceived by the mind, and when we
think of it we do not think of its ghost, but we think of
the thing itself. Did Laura Bridgman, who had neither
eye-sight nor hearing nor speech, but who acquired all her
ideas of external objects by the sense of touch, conceive of
a round or a square, a rough or a smooth surface, by contemplating
the ghost or double of what she touched? And
had she no thinking in the true sense of thinking, because
the double, or <em>imago</em> of the thing which she touched&mdash;the
so-called <em>noumenon</em>&mdash;was at once necessary to her mental
perception, and yet could not be thought of without seeing
the object by the corporeal eye? She had no corporeal eye
in which there was any vision. All her mental perceptions
of external objects were acquired by the sense of touch
alone; and we may well believe that she did not need the
supposed <em>noumenon</em> to give her an idea of <em>phenomenon</em>.
She perceived many phenomena by the simple transmission
to her brain, along her nerves of touch, of the impressions
produced upon them by external objects; and there is
every reason to believe that many of her perceptions were
as accurate and true as those which we derive from all our
senses. We may now dismiss Mr. Spencer's distinction
between <em>phenomenon</em> and <em>noumenon</em> as a distinction quite
needless for the elucidation of what takes place in thinking
of that which is behind appearance, and may proceed
with the discussion of what remains of the passage above
quoted.</p>

<p>At the risk of wearying by repetition, I will again resort
to the illustration before employed, and will again describe
how we reach the conception, for example, of endless space.
According to Mr. Spencer, space, or extension, as a thinkable
idea, or a subject of thought, is confined to a measurable
extent of space. This is the phenomenon, or appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>ance.
All our forms of thought are, it is said, molded on
our experience of phenomena that are measurable, or capable
of being definitely described; and the connotations of
our words which express the relations of phenomena relate
to phenomena that we measure, or see, and can definitely
describe. Therefore, we can not think of a reality that is
behind appearance; can not bring the consciousness of
such a reality into any shape, nor bring into any shape its
connection with appearance.</p>

<p>If mankind are never to think of that which is behind
appearance&mdash;can never think of a reality that is behind
what they see&mdash;because their forms of thought are molded
on experiences of phenomena that they see, and because
the connotations of their words express the relations of
those phenomena and no others, a vast domain of thinking
is necessarily closed to them. This is not the experience of
our minds. Every day of our lives we go on in search of
that which is beyond appearance, and we find it. Take
again, for example, the phenomena of a measurable portion
of space or time. What appears to us gives an idea of
space and time. We measure as great a portion of either
as our forms of expression admit of our describing by definite
terms, but we are immediately conscious of another
reality, an endless extension or duration, because we are
conscious that we have not exhausted and can not exhaust,
by our measurements and descriptions, the whole possible
existence of space or time. This new reality behind appearance
is just as truly thinkable, just as true a consciousness,
as is the measurable portion of time or space; for it
is time or space of which we are constantly thinking,
whether it is an extent or duration which we can describe
in words, or whether we can only say that it is extent or
duration without beginning and without end. Our minds
are so constituted that the existence which is manifested to
us by observable phenomena leads us to go behind the ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>pearance
in search of another reality beyond that which is
manifested by the phenomena that we see. All that is inscrutable
about this other reality that lies behind appearance
is that we can not understand how it came to be, any
more than we can understand how the phenomenon which
we see and can measure and describe in a definite form
came to exist. We do not bring, and do not need to bring,
this other reality into connection with appearance. We
first have an idea of space and time from observable and
measurable phenomena. The reality of extension without
limit, and duration without end, follows of necessity, by a
process of thought which we can not escape.</p>

<p>But now it becomes needful to answer a further objection.
I have said that we are all the while thinking of space,
whether it is a measurable and limited or an immeasurable
and illimitable space. Mr. Spencer, anticipating this obvious
statement, admits that the form of relation between
the two ideas, although "almost blank," preserves a certain
qualitative character; that is, it is of the quality of
space of which we think, whether it is measurable or immeasurable,
and therefore it remains "a vaguely identifiable
relation." But when, in place of one of the terms of
the relation qualitatively the same as the other, we substitute
an existence that can not be defined, and is therefore
both quantitatively and qualitatively unrepresentable, the
relation, he asserts, lapses entirely; one of the terms becomes
wholly "unknowable."</p>

<p>I will not again repeat that extension or magnitude
having no known limits is a thinkable term, because the
subject of thought is the quality of extension or magnitude;
quantity not being essential to the idea of extension or
magnitude. But I will pass to the idea of an existence
which can not be defined. I suppose that by an existence
is meant a being. If we undertake to think of a being
whose quality we do not know to be the same as the quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of another being whom we do know, and the quantity of
whose powers and faculties we can not measure, we propose,
says Mr. Spencer, a term of impossible thought, because
the law of thought can not be conformed to; the
term can not be present to the mind, and no thinkable relation
can be framed. Let this supposed difficulty be tested
by a plain inquiry into that which we undertake to make
the subject of thought when we think of a being who is
said to be "unknowable."</p>

<p>"Agnosticism" is a doctrine which eludes a definite
grasp. I have seen it defined by one of its most distinguished
professors in this way: "Agnosticism is of the
essence of science, whether ancient or modern. It simply
means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that
which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know
or believe.... Agnosticism simply says that we know
nothing of what may be beyond phenomena."<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Mankind
are apt to be rather practical in their habits of thinking:
experience teaches them that there is a well-founded distinction
between knowledge and belief, when it comes to
be a question of asserting the one or the other.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> They
find, too, by experience that, in regard to what they speak
of when they say that they know a thing, there is a distinction
to be observed in respect to the means of knowledge.
No one hesitates to say that he knows there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
such a man as Napoleon Bonaparte, although he never
saw him, and although our knowledge of him is now derived
from hearsay. But when we speak of knowing that a
certain living person was at a certain spot on a certain day,
we become immediately aware that in order to justify the
assertion we or some one ought to have seen the person at
the time and place, especially if anything important depends
upon the assertion. There are a great many things
that we say we know without scientific or other rigorous
proof, and there are a great many other things which we
do not say that we know without the kind of proof which
is required. All our actions in life proceed upon this distinction,
and we could not live in this world with any comfort
if we did not act upon the assumption that we know
things of which we have no scientific proof.</p>

<p>A very clever <i lang="fr">jeu d'esprit</i> went the rounds of the periodical
press some time ago, in which a well-born and highly
educated young agnostic was represented as losing his birthright,
his <em>fiancée</em>, and all his prospects in life, because he
demanded rigorous proof of everything that affected him.
As he would not admit that he was the son of his own
parents, without having better proof of it than their assertion,
he was turned out-of-doors and disinherited. He
would not accept the bloom on the cheek of his mistress as
natural unless she gave him her word that she did not
paint; and he would not admit that they loved each other
without some better proof than their mutual feelings,
about which they might be mistaken. The young lady
indignantly dismissed him, but he consoled himself as a
martyr to the truth of agnosticism. He became tutor to
the son of a nobleman, whose belief in the boy's extraordinary
talents, although justified by his progress in his studies,
the tutor would not admit had the requisite proof.
He propounded his denial of what the father had no proper
grounds for maintaining, in an offensive way, and of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
he lost his place. He retired to a sort of agnostic brotherhood,
glorying in his adhesion to truth. Some of his companions
remained long enough in the brotherhood to find
out that they were making fools of themselves, and at the
first opportunity for acting on the ordinary grounds of
knowing a fact without rigorous demonstration of it they
left him in solitude, went into the world, and achieved
success.</p>

<p>"A man shall not say he knows or believes that which
he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe."
By "scientific grounds," I presume is meant, in
the case of a fact or occurrence, proper proof of the fact
or occurrence. This varies with the nature of the thing
which one professes to know. We constantly act upon
proofs which do not amount to demonstration, and there
could be no practical enjoyment of our lives and no safety
if we did not. If a government were to receive information
that a foreign army was on the border of the country
and about to invade it, and the information fell short of
being the testimony of eye-witnesses, what would be thought
of the rulers if they were to fold their hands and say that
they did not know the fact because they had no "scientific
grounds for professing to know it"? On the other hand,
if in a court of justice the question to be determined were
the presence of an individual at a certain place and at a
certain time, the established rules of evidence require certain
kinds of proof of the fact.</p>

<p>Belief, however, is a conviction of something which may
or may not require what are called "scientific grounds"
before we can be permitted to profess that we believe. It
depends upon the thing which we profess to believe, and
upon the grounds on which we rest the belief, whether we
have or have not safe and sufficient means of belief. Belief
in the law of gravitation as a force operating throughout
the universe is arrived at as a deduction from scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
data. Belief in an existence beyond phenomena, in a being
who is the producing agent of the phenomena, depends
upon a great variety of grounds, some of which are scientific
data and some of which are the elements of moral
reasoning. We may not say that we "<em>know</em>" that God or
any other supernatural being exists, but we may say that we
"<em>believe</em>" in his existence. Here knowledge is one thing;
belief is another. Knowledge of the existence of God, like
knowledge of the existence of any other being, might come
to us through the testimony of a competent witness commissioned
and authorized to inform us. Belief in the existence
of God may be founded on many and various grounds
without the direct testimony of the competent witness;
and these grounds may be perfectly satisfactory without
being mathematical or scientific demonstration. It is a very
remarkable fact that some of the most eminent of the
school of agnosticism profess to have, and probably have,
the most undoubting faith in the theory and actual occurrence
of animal evolution, without any data, scientific or
other, which can enable other men to arrive at the same
conviction, whatever may be the character of the supposed
proofs. They certainly have no grounds for professing to
know that an evolution of species out of species has ever
taken place; and the grounds of their belief in the fact,
whether denominated "scientific" or called something else,
do not satisfy the rules of belief on which mankind must
act, in accordance with their mental and moral constitutions;
and this belief does not rise any higher in the scale
of moral probabilities than the belief in special creations,
nor does it rise so high. But to return to Mr. Spencer.</p>

<p>If we did not act upon the process of thinking of another
reality than that which appearance gives, act upon
it fearlessly and by a mode of thinking to which we can
safely trust ourselves, science would stand still, there would
be no progress in physics, discoveries would cease, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
would be no improvement in morals, the world would remain
stationary. What did Columbus do, when, going
behind the phenomena that made the earth appear to be a
flat surface, he thought of it as a sphere? Did he break
the law of thought? He formed an idea of a reality behind
appearance, not by employing the phenomenal manifestations
to help him to the new conception, but by going
away from them in search of a reality that lay behind
them, and which they seemed to contradict. This conception
of a sphere as the reality of the earth's condition
proved to be the truth. He did not bring it, and did not
need to bring it, into connection with appearance. He did
not use, and did not need to use, the relations of the visible
phenomena to help him to attain his conception of a spherical
form of the earth. He contradicted them all.</p>

<p>Did all the moral lawgivers who have reformed the
world break the law of thought, when, going behind the
phenomena of human conduct, with their relations pointing
to one idea of right and wrong, they conceived the idea
of a new and a better rule of life? When it was said, in
place of the old law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth, "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute
you"&mdash;when for the old rule of revenge there was substituted
forgiveness of injuries&mdash;something was inculcated
that contradicted all the appearances of the social phenomena,
and that lay beyond them. Did the consciousness
of this new reality become "a formless consciousness
of the inscrutable"? What is there about it that is inscrutable?
There is nothing inscrutable about it, or in the
consciousness of it, excepting the mode in which the being
who promulgated it came to exist. The idea of forgiveness
is clearly within the compass of human thought and of
human endeavor.</p>

<p>When we are in the process of making a new physical
discovery, or of forming a new rule of moral action, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
work away from the materials which the phenomenal
manifestations give us, to a new conception. We become
conscious of a new reality behind appearance, and of an
existence beyond the relations of the phenomena with which
we have heretofore been familiar. It is to this striving after
realities behind appearances&mdash;striving by an entirely true
process of thinking&mdash;that the world owes its progress.</p>

<p>When the phenomenal manifestations of an intellectual
and moral nature in man have given us the idea of an existence
of an intellectual and moral being as a reality of
which we become conscious, what is to prevent us from
thinking of another intellectual and moral being as a reality,
with faculties and powers immeasurably superior to
ours? It is true that the phenomenal manifestations of
man's intellectual and moral nature give us an idea of a
being of very limited faculties and very imperfect moral
qualities. But what is the "insoluble difficulty" in which
we become involved, when we think of a being whose faculties
are boundless, and whose moral nature is perfect?
Does the "insoluble difficulty" consist in the impossibility
of thinking of that which transcends all our powers of
measurement? All that we have done, in the case of man,
is to have a consciousness of a being whose phenomenal
manifestations evince the existence of an intellectual and
moral nature. He happens to be a being of very limited
faculties and very imperfect moral characteristics. What
prevents us from thinking, in the true sense of thinking, of
another being, whose powers are without limit, and whose
moral nature is perfect? Is it said that we can not bring
into any shape the idea of unlimited power or of perfect
goodness, or bring into any shape its connection with appearance,
because all our ideas of power and goodness, all
our forms of thought and expression, are molded on experiences
of limited power and imperfect goodness? The
truth is that we do not and need not strive to bring into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
connection with appearance the idea of any quality which
we conceive of as unlimited. What we derive from the
phenomenal manifestations of human power and goodness
is a consciousness of the qualities of power and goodness.
It is perfectly correct thinking to reason that these qualities,
whose phenomenal manifestations, in the case of man,
show that in him they exist only in a limited degree, may
exist in another being in unlimited perfection and without
degree. Our minds are so constituted that we reason from
the finite to the infinite, by observing that one class of
phenomena evince the existence of the finite and another
class of phenomena evince the existence of the infinite.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we pass from the phenomenal manifestations
of human power and goodness, we come into the
presence of other phenomena which we know could not be
and were not produced by such a limited and imperfect
being as man, but which must yet have had an author, a
maker, an originator, a creator. We thus contemplate and
investigate facts which show that the phenomena were the
products of a skill, wisdom, and power that transcend all
measurement. Is it said that the phenomena of nature,
stupendous and varied and minute and wonderful as they
are, evince only that a certain degree of power and wisdom
was exerted in their production, even if their production is
attributed to a being competent to bring them about?
And therefore that the idea of a being of unlimited faculties
and perfect goodness is as far as ever from our reach
by any true process of thought? This assumption begs
something that should not be taken for granted. It assumes
that the production of the phenomena of nature
does not evince unlimited power and perfect goodness; did
not call for the existence of boundless faculties and inexhaustible
benevolence; involved only a degree of such qualities,
although a vastly superior degree to that possessed
by us. The correctness of this assumption depends upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the force of the evidence which nature affords of the character
of the Deity. It is an assumption which has led to
enormous errors&mdash;errors of conception and belief which
impute to the Supreme Being only a superior degree of
power and wisdom, greater than our own, but still limited
and imperfect, liable to error, and acting in modes which
distress us with contradictions and inconsistencies.</p>

<p>It may without rashness be asserted that the phenomena
of the universe could not have been produced by a power
and wisdom that were subject to any limitations. While
all the researches of science, from the first beginnings of
human observation to the present moment, show that in
the production of the phenomena of nature there has been
exerted a certain amount of power and wisdom, they also
show that it is an amount which we can not measure; that
there is, moreover, a power and wisdom that have not been
exhausted; that the reserved force and skill and benevolence
are without limit. For, in every successive new discovery
that we make, in every new revelation of the power
and goodness which our investigations bring forth, we continuously
reach proofs of an endless capacity, an inexhaustible
variety of methods and of products. So that, if we conceive
of the whole human race, with all its accumulated
knowledge, as ending at last in one individual possessed of
all that has been learned on earth, and imagine him to be
then translated to another state of existence, with all his faculties
of observation and study preserved, and new fields of
inquiry to be opened to him, his experience on earth would
lead him to expect to find, and we must believe that in his
new experience he will find, that the physical and the moral
phenomena of the universe are an inexhaustible study;
that search and discovery must go on forever; and that
forever new revelations of power and goodness will be made
to the perceptions whose training began in a very limited
sphere. His experience in that limited sphere has taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
him that there was no end to the discoveries which were
here partially within his reach. His experience in the new
sphere will be a continuation of his experience in the old
one; for there is a law by which we judge of the future by
the past. This law is one of the conditions of our intellectual
existence; an inevitable habit of our minds; imposed
upon us by an inexorable but familiar authority.
Our experience in this life has taught us that, in the investigation
of the phenomena of nature that are open to our
observation here, we have never reached the end of possible
discovery; that every fresh discovery has evinced that
there are still new things to be learned, new manifestations
of power to be revealed, new products and new methods to
be seen. However long we may suppose the human race to
exist on earth and its researches to be prosecuted here, we
must suppose an endless accumulation of knowledge hereafter,
because the law which compels us to judge of the
future by the past obliges us to accept as the fruition of
the future that which has been the fruition of the past.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Is there in this any violation of the true law of thought?
Does the relation between our past experience and the experience
which we forecast for the future fade into a dim
symbol of a relation? On the contrary, both are equally
capable of mental representation; for we are mentally so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
constituted that the consciousness of what has happened to
us in the past&mdash;the unending succession of new discoveries,
the constant accumulation of knowledge, which we have
experienced here&mdash;gives us the conception of the same endless
progress hereafter, compels us to believe in it, and enables
us to grasp it as a product of true thought.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer has much to say of "the imbecility of
human intelligence when brought to bear on the ultimate
question." What is the ultimate question? The ultimate
question with which science and philosophy are concerned
is the existence of the Supreme Being. It is of the utmost
consequence for us to understand wherein consists the imbecility
of human intelligence when brought to bear upon
this question of the existence of God. How does our imbecility
manifest itself? What is the point beyond which
thought can not go? We become conscious of the existence
of the being called man, because, from the phenomena
which we know that he produces by the exercise of his will
and power, and which we know must have had an author and
producer, we deduce an existence beyond the phenomena,
an actor in their production. What more, or what that is
different, do we do or undertake to do, when, from the
phenomena of nature which we know that man did not
produce, we think of another existence beyond the phenomena?
In both cases, we study the phenomena by our
senses and powers of observation; in both cases we reason
that there is an actor who produces the phenomena; yet
the existence of the actor who produces the phenomena is
inscrutable in the case of the Deity in the same sense and
for the same reason that it is inscrutable in the case of man.
How the human mind came to exist, by what process it was
made to exist, by what means it was created, what was the
genesis of the human intellect, is just as inscrutable, no
more and no less so, as the mode in which the Deity came
to exist. In both cases the existence of a being is what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
think of; and when we think of either being we think
of that which is beyond phenomena but which we deduce
from phenomena. In neither case do we "accept a formless
consciousness of the inscrutable"; for what we accept is
the consciousness of a being, and it is not a consciousness of
the mode in which he came to exist. The latter consciousness
is the inscrutable problem. The existence is what we
think of, and we think of it by a perfectly true process of
thought, deducing it from the simple truth that the phenomena
must have had an actor in their production. We
do not undertake to think of the process by which man
was created, or of the mode in which that other existence
came to be without beginning and without end.</p>

<p>I have thus discriminated between what we do and what
we do not think of, when we think of an existence beyond
phenomena, but which we deduce from phenomena. This
is a most necessary discrimination; for, in thinking of the
existence, we do not try to think how it came to be an existence.
We think only of the existence; and we deduce
it from our observation and study of phenomena, which
teach us that they must have had an actor, an author, a
producer, and that they did not produce or create themselves.</p>

<p>It remains for me to advert to Mr. Spencer's theory of
the origin of the religious consciousness, or the origin of
the idea of supernatural beings, and hence of one highest
supernatural being. This is his ghost-theory. He has recently
told us that in his "Descriptive Sociology"&mdash;a
work commenced in 1867, and which preceded his "Principles
of Sociology" (written in 1874)&mdash;he caused to be
gathered adequate materials for generalization, consisting
of a great number of excerpts from the writings of travelers
and historians who have given accounts of the religious beliefs
of the uncivilized races. He numbers 697 of these
extracts which refer to the ghost-theory, and only 87 which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
refer to fetichism. This great ratio of eight to one he considers
overwhelming proof that the ghost-theory, as opposed
to fetichism, is sustained by the beliefs of a vast majority
of the uncivilized races. What if it is? What is the
ghost-theory, and what is fetichism, as the chief source and
origin of religion? Mr. Spencer, in his recent article, explains
fetichism as most persons understand it, namely,
the worship of inanimate objects, or belief in their supernatural
powers. The ghost-theory, which his 697 extracts
illustrate, is "the belief in a wandering double, which goes
away during sleep, or fainting, and deserts the body for a
longer period at death; a double which can enter and possess
other persons, causing disease, epilepsy, insanity, etc.,
which gives rise to ideas of spirits, demons, etc., and which,
originates propitiation and worship of ghosts."<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Further
on, he reiterates his ghost-theory as the origin of religious
beliefs, and explains it thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Setting out with the statement that "unlike the ordinary consciousness,
the religious consciousness is concerned with that which
lies beyond the sphere of sense," I went on to show that the rise of
this consciousness begins among primitive men with the belief in a
double belonging to each individual, which, capable of wandering
away from him during life, becomes his ghost or spirit after death;
and that from this idea of a being eventually distinguished as supernatural,
there develop, in course of time, the ideas of supernatural
beings of all orders up to the highest. Mr. Harrison has alleged that
the primitive religion is not belief in and propitiation of the ghost,
but is worship of "physical objects treated frankly as physical objects"
(p. 498). That he has disproved the one view and proved
the other, no one will, I think, assert. Contrariwise, he has given
occasion for me to cite weighty authorities against him.</p>

<p>Next it was contended that in the assemblage of supernatural
beings thus originating in each tribe, some, derived from chiefs,
were superior to others; and that, as the compounding and recompounding
of tribes gave origin to societies having social grades and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
rulers of different orders, there resulted that conception of a hierarchy
of ghosts or gods which polytheism shows us. Further it
was argued that while, with the growth of civilization and knowledge,
the minor supernatural agents became merged in the major
supernatural agent, this single great supernatural agent, gradually
losing the anthropomorphic attributes at first ascribed, has come in
our days to retain but few of them; and, eventually losing these,
will then merge into a consciousness of an Omnipresent Power to
which no attributes can be ascribed. This proposition has not been
contested.</p></blockquote>

<p>Without entering into any consideration of what Mr.
Harrison has disproved or proved, as between fetichism and
the ghost-theory, I will now ask why the beliefs of the uncivilized
races, or of the primitive men, should be regarded
as important evidence of the origin of beliefs among civilized
and cultivated men? Is modern philosophy, in accounting
for or justifying the belief in a Supreme Being
which is held to-day by most of the cultivated and educated
part of mankind, to assign its origin to the primitive and
uncivilized men? Is the whole idea of a supernatural
being to be regarded as traditionally handed down from
our barbarian ancestors? Is there no other source from
which we can derive that idea? Are we none of us capable
of finding for ourselves rational grounds of belief in a supernatural
agent, deducing his existence from a study of
nature? Or must we trace this belief back through the
ages until we arrive at an origin which we shall of course
despise? What has philosophy to do now with "the
primitive religion"? Is there nothing that science and
reason and disciplined methods of thought and sound
deduction can teach us? Are we to throw away all the
proofs which nature spreads before us, and for the investigation
of which we have accumulated so many facilities,
and turn to the beliefs of uncivilized men? Are the conceptions
of supernatural beings, to which a barbarian at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>tained,
to be taken as the origin of the conception of a
personal God to which an educated philosopher can now
attain? And because of the inadequate and childish superstitions
of the past, and of their growth into a belief of one
supreme supernatural agent&mdash;whatever that idea of him may
have been&mdash;is the consciousness which we have of a personal
God to be hereafter merged into a consciousness of
an Omnipresent Power to which no attributes can be ascribed?</p>

<p>It should seem that the mode in which philosophy, after
it came to be cultivated by civilized thinkers and observers,
freed itself first from fetichism and the ghost-theory and
all the beliefs of polytheism, next from physical agents as
the causes of all phenomena, and finally attained an independent
conception of a First Cause as a supreme personal
intelligence and power, is worthy of some consideration.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of this work, borrowing from the
English scholar and critic, Mr. Grote, I have given a condensed
account of some of the systems of Greek philosophy
which began in the first half of the sixth century before
Christ, and extended down to Plato, whose life was embraced
in 427-347 of the ante-Christian era. About 150
<span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, the Greek philosophy, and especially the speculations
of Plato, encountered at Alexandria the monotheism of the
Hellenizing Jews.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> This history of Greek philosophy, as
developed by Mr. Grote, shows that the struggle against
polytheistic agencies, as the causes of natural phenomena,
began with efforts to find purely physical agencies; that
this struggle, in spite of the surrounding beliefs in a multitude
of supernatural beings of different orders, was long
continued, and gave rise to a most remarkable variety of
scientific explanations: that it passed through an extraordinary
number of physical theories, until at length in Plato<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
there was developed the idea of a distinct personal constructive
actor, the Demiurgus, a being to whom, whether
intended by Plato as a philosophical myth, or as an entity
in which he had something of faith or conviction, he assigned
the formation of his Kosmos. With characteristic
acumen, the English commentator points out Plato's skill
in eluding the possible charge of infidelity to the established
religion of Athens, while he at the same time propounded
the existence of a personal First Cause that was in a striking
degree inconsistent with the popular faith. The whole
course of this history of Greek speculation evinces that
from an early period the Greek philosophers were utter
skeptics in regard to the popular religion and the poetic
traditions; that they not only did not derive anything from
the primitive religion, from fetichism, from the ghost-beliefs
of their barbarian ancestors&mdash;if their ancestors had
such beliefs&mdash;or from their heroic ages, or from the multitudinous
gods of the popular theology and the popular
worship, or from the old poetical imagery, but that they
strove to get away from all these sources, and to construct
theories of the universe that would explain the ultimate
cause or causes in a very different manner. The earliest
Greek speculators got no further in their theories than the
construction of systems of physical agencies, or agencies
that stood to them in the quality of physical actors. Plato,
on the other hand, resorted to the conception of a supreme
personal actor.</p>

<p>Mr. Grote has further mentioned a very striking fact,
which is, that before the Christian era, the Demiurgus of
Plato was received by the Hellenizing Jews at Alexandria as
a conception kindred to the God of Moses. His statement,
in substance the same as that previously made by a Continental
critic, Gfrörer, is so interesting and important
that I quote his words: "But though the idea of a pre-kosmic
Demiurgus found little favor among the Grecian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
schools of philosophy before the Christian era, it was greatly
welcomed among the Hellenizing Jews at Alexandria,
from Aristobulus (about <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 150) down to Philo. It
formed the suitable point of conjunction between Hellenic
and Judaic speculation. The marked distinction drawn by
Plato between the Demiurgus, and the constructed or generated
Kosmos, with its in-dwelling gods, provided a suitable
place for the Supreme God of the Jews, degrading the
pagan gods by comparison. The 'Timæus' was compared
with the book of Genesis, from which it was even affirmed
that Plato had copied. He received the denomination of
the Atticising Moses&mdash;Moses writing in Attic Greek. It
was thus that the Platonic 'Timæus' became the medium
of transition from the polytheistic theology, which served
as philosophy among the early ages of Greece, to the omnipotent
monotheism to which philosophy became subordinated
after the Christian era."<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps there is no more remarkable fact than this in
the whole history of philosophical speculation. Possibly
Mr. Spencer would say that it adds another proof to his
ghost-theory. But the important fact is that Plato's Demiurgus
partakes in no degree of the ghost idea, and, instead
of being a modification of that idea, is an original and perfectly
independent conception. The Demiurgus of Plato
is not a chief spirit evolved in imagination out of a hierarchy
of spirits. He is himself the originator and fashioner
of the gods, of whom he makes use as ministers in
the formation of the bodies of the primitive men, after he
has himself formed the souls which are to inhabit them for
a season.</p>

<p>It appears, by Mr. Grote's citations from Gfrörer, that
the latter had previously noted what Aristobulus maintained
one hundred and fifty years earlier than Philo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
namely, that "not only the oldest Grecian poets, Homer,
Hesiod, Orpheus, etc., but also the most celebrated thinkers,
especially Plato, had acquired all their wisdom from a very
old translation of the Pentateuch." Neither of these modern
critics appears to have accepted the assertion of Aristobulus,
and its intrinsic improbability is very great. Certainly
the internal evidence of the "Timæus" negatives
the assumption that Plato had seen the Pentateuch, for his
Demiurgus is not the God of Moses, although it was very
natural for the Alexandrian Jews to think they recognized a
resemblance. Mr. Grote, moreover, seems to put this matter
beyond doubt, for he says that the Platonic "Timæus"
<em>became the medium of transition</em> from the polytheism of
early Greece to the monotheism of the Christian era. This
implies very clearly that Mr. Grote did not consider the
Demiurgus of Plato to be either derived from the polytheism
of the early Grecian ages, on the one hand, or from
the Mosaic Jehovah, on the other hand, but that he considered
it a conception which stood between them. The
point of resemblance is in the idea of a divine and supreme
personal actor in the production of phenomena.</p>

<p>It does not seem, therefore, that a philosopher at the
present day is confined to the source of the primitive religion,
be that source what it may. The primitive religion,
whether its origin was fetichism or a belief in ghosts, has
imposed no shackles upon our minds. The beliefs of the
primitive men may have originated as Mr. Spencer supposes,
but the question for us&mdash;revelation being laid aside&mdash;is
just what it was for Plato, the difference being that our
means of investigation are superior to his. The grounds
of our belief in a personal God are not the same as those
on which the uncivilized races formed first the idea of a
wandering double emanating from the human body, then
conceived of spirits or ghosts, next of different orders of
spirits or ghosts, and finally of a chief and supreme spirit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Our materials for sound deduction are not the same as
those of the primitive races of mankind, or of the uncivilized
tribes of the present day. I have before remarked
that the intellectual effort of a savage in striving for the
idea of a deity is the same kind of effort as that of the
civilized and educated man; but that the difference between
them is in the growth and activity of the reasoning
power, and in the materials on which it is exercised. While
our barbarian predecessors lived in an age of ignorance, we
live in an age of knowledge. We are surrounded by extraordinary
discoveries, and are possessed of the means of
still further research. They had almost no means for investigating
physical phenomena. We are, or ought to be,
disciplined reasoners. They, on the contrary, while able
to reason correctly on a very few subjects, could not reason
correctly on all subjects. We are, or ought to be, capable
of subjecting the materials which the phenomena of nature
spread before us, to sound processes of thought and to
logical deductions. We are, or ought to be, capable of discriminating
between that which is really inscrutable and
that which is not so. We are, or ought to be, able to know
when we are within the bounds of possible thought, and
when we transcend them. We are, or ought to be, able to
see that the existence of phenomena necessarily implies a
causing power; that when the phenomena are such as we
know that man produces, the idea of an intelligent personal
actor is both a legitimate deduction and a perfectly
appreciable subject of thought. Are we not entitled to
apply the same reasoning to the phenomena of nature which
we know that man did not produce? And when we so
reason, do we borrow anything whatever from the primitive
idea of ghosts or spirits, whether they are supposed to have
first emanated from human bodies, or to reside in inanimate
objects?</p>

<p>There are two distinct values to be assigned to the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>searches
of science. One of them consists in the practical
improvement of the material condition of society; the lessening
of physical evil, the increase of physical good; the
advancement of our power over matter. In an age intensely
devoted to this materialistic improvement, there will be
a great accumulation of physical knowledge. At the same
time there are accumulating in the same ratio new materials
for philosophical speculation concerning the causes of
the phenomena that are investigated. The specialists who
carry on the investigations may not always be the best
reasoners in the application of the new materials to the
purpose of philosophical inquiry into the producing causes
of the phenomena. But the other distinct value of their
investigations consists in the accumulation of materials
from which the philosopher can deduce the existence of an
actor in the production of the phenomena. When, from
these materials, constantly accumulating and constantly to
be used in a uniform process of reasoning to which the
human mind is both able and obliged to resort, the philosopher
deduces the conception of a supreme, personal, intelligent
being, he assigns to that being just those attributes
which the phenomena of nature compel him to believe in,
because if the attributes did not exist the phenomena of
nature could not have become what they are. There can
be no reason to suppose that as the materials increase, as
the researches of science, for whatever purpose carried on,
lead to greater and still greater accumulations of knowledge,
the law of thought by which we deduce the idea of
an actor in the production of phenomena will change, or
that the logical necessity for conceiving, or the intellectual
capacity to conceive of, the attributes of that actor will
either diminish or fade away. An Omnipotent Power
without attributes, or one to which no attributes can be
assigned, is not likely to be the end of all philosophical
speculation about the ultimate cause. Power without at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>tributes,
power without a determining will, power without
guidance, or purposes, or objects, is not a conception to
which a well-trained intellect is now likely to attain; and
the greater the accumulation of physical knowledge becomes,
the greater will be the necessity to such an intellect
for recognizing attributes, and for assigning them to the
power which is manifested by the phenomena.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Spencer, the process by which mankind
are ultimately to lose the consciousness of a personal
Deity is the following: Anthropomorphic attributes were at
first ascribed to the single great supernatural agent of
whom the primitive men conceived. But in our days, the
idea of such a supreme supernatural agent has come to retain
but a few of these attributes. These few will eventually
be lost, and there will be nothing left but a consciousness
of an Omnipotent Power to which no attributes can
be ascribed. The probability of this result depends upon
the necessity for ascribing what are called anthropomorphic
attributes to the Supreme Being; or, in other words, it depends
upon the inquiry whether, in order to ascribe to the
Supreme Being any attributes at all, we are necessarily
confined to those which are anthropomorphic.</p>

<p>"Anthropomorphism," a term compounded from the
Greek ἄνθρωπος, man, and μορφή, form, has come to signify
the representation of the Deity under a human form,
or with human attributes and affections. It is therefore
important to know what we in fact do, when reasoning on
the phenomena of nature, we reach the conclusion that
they must have had an author or producer, and then ascribe
to him certain attributes. The fact that the ancient religious
beliefs ascribed to the Supreme Being grossly anthropomorphic
attributes, is unimportant. So is the fact that
the anthropomorphic attributes have been slowly diminishing
in the conceptions of the reasoning and cultivated part
of mankind. The really important question is whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
there can be no conception of a Supreme Being without
ascribing to him attributes which liken him to man; or
whether, when the anthropomorphic attributes are lost,
the idea of a personal God will be lost.</p>

<p>The essential character of any anthropomorphic or human
attribute&mdash;power for example, or wisdom, or goodness&mdash;is
that it is limited, imperfect, and liable to error. But
when we conceive of these qualities as existing in absolute
perfection and boundless capacity, while we retain the idea
that they are personal qualities, we in fact divest them of
their anthropomorphic or human character. It is a contradiction
in terms to say that an imperfect human capacity
is the same attribute as a divine and unlimited capacity.
The difficulty with the ancient religious beliefs, the
whole error of anthropomorphism, was that the conceptions
stopped short of the idea of unlimited power, wisdom, and
benevolence. The attributes ascribed to the Deity likened
him to man in form, character, powers, dispositions, passions.
He was an exaggerated human being, with vastly
more power, more skill, more wisdom, but still with the
same kind of power, skill, and wisdom, actuated by like
motives and governed by like passions. Now the truth is,
that the difference between a limited and imperfect attribute
of character and one that is boundless&mdash;power, for example&mdash;is
more than a difference of degree. It is a difference
in kind; for while in both cases we conceive of a personal
capacity to act and a will to guide the act, in the one
case we are thinking of that which is inferior, limited, and
feeble, and in the other case we are thinking of that which
knows no limitations and is absolutely inexhaustible. It
is not true, therefore, that there can be no conception of a
Supreme Being without ascribing to him human attributes.
When we reason from phenomena to the conclusion that
they must have had an author&mdash;when we reach the conviction
that phenomena must have had a cause, that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
must have been an actor, a process, and a product&mdash;we
have to deal with two classes of phenomena. One is the
class in which we know, from the observations of our senses
and our experience, that the author and actor was man.
It becomes verified to us with irresistible certainty that the
phenomena of human society were produced by an actor,
and that that actor was man; a personal agent with a
limited and imperfect power. When we turn to the phenomena
of nature which we know that man did not produce,
we are led by the same irresistible logical sequence of
thought to the conviction that these phenomena must have
been caused to exist, for human reason revolts at the idea
that the phenomena which exist were not caused to exist.
We come immediately to perceive that the phenomena of
nature are of such a character that the power which has
produced them must not only have been superhuman, but
it must have been absolutely boundless. At the moment
we depart from the investigation of phenomena which belong
in the department of human efforts, and come to the phenomena
which belong in the department of nature alone,
while the necessity for a personal actor continues, the character
and capacities of the actor become entirely changed.
We see that the phenomena of nature required for their
production power without limitation, skill incapable of
error, benevolence that was inexhaustible. We thus pass
entirely away from anthropomorphic attributes, to the conception
of attributes that are not human. We may go on
to divest the idea of a Supreme Being of all the attributes
that can appropriately be classed as anthropomorphic, and
there will still remain the conception of a Supreme Being to
whom we not only may but must ascribe attributes that are
forced upon our convictions, not because some of them belong
in an inferior degree to man, but because all of them are of
such a character that if they did not exist in boundless
perfection the phenomena of nature could not have existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the origins which have been assigned to religious
beliefs, there is one remarkable hypothesis which may
be contrasted with the ghost-theory, and which, so far as
the beliefs of cultivated men at the present day are concerned,
is about as important as the origin of the belief in
ghosts, or as fetichism. It seems that some of the Greek
philosophers and historians, entirely regardless of the ghost-theory
as the origin of beliefs in supernatural beings, considered
that they were fictions invented by the first lawgivers,
and promulgated by them for useful purposes. Belief
in the gods was thus imposed by the authority of those
who organized society and dictated what men were to believe
in order to exercise a useful restraint. Plato himself
regarded this as the origin of what the communities around
him believed respecting the attributes and acts of the gods;
the matters believed being fictions prescribed by the lawgivers.
In his "Republic," in which he sketches the entire
political, social, ethical, and religious constitution of
an ideal city, assuming it to be planned and put in operation
by an absolute and unlimited authority, he laid it
down as essential for the lawgiver to determine what the
fictions were to be in which his own community were to
be required to believe. Some fictions there must be; for
in the community there would be originally nothing but a
vague emotional tendency to belief in supernatural beings,
and this tendency must be availed of by some positive
mythical inventions which it was for the lawgiver to produce
and the citizens to accept. Such fictions were the
accredited stories about the gods and heroes, which formed
the religious beliefs among Plato's contemporaries, and
were everywhere embodied in the works of poets, painters,
and sculptors, and in the religious ceremonies. But the
ancient fictions were, in Plato's opinion, bad, inasmuch as
they gave wrong ethical ideas of the characters of the gods.
They did not rest upon traditionary evidence, or divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
inspiration, being merely pious frauds, constructed by authority
and for an orthodox purpose. But they did not
fulfill the purpose as well as they should have done. Accordingly,
Plato directs in his "Republic" the coinage of
a new body of legends, for which he claims no character of
veracity, but which will be more in harmony with what he
conceives to be the true characters of the gods, and will
produce a more salutary ethical effect upon those who are
to be the efficient rulers of the commonwealth after it is
founded. As the founder of his ideal city, he claims and
exercises an exclusive monopoly of coining and circulating
such fictions, and they are to be absolutely accepted by
those who are to constitute its rulers, and who are to promulgate
and teach them to the community, as the physician
administers wholesome remedies. To prevent the
circulation of dissenting narratives, he establishes a peremptory
censorship. There is thus no question of absolute
truth or absolute falsehood. That is true which is stamped
at the mint of the lawgiver, and that is false which he
interdicts.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Nowhere has orthodoxy been rested more distinctly
upon the basis of absolute human authority&mdash;authority acting
upon the highest motives of the public good, for the
most salutary purposes, but without claiming anything in
the nature of divine inspiration, or even pretending to any
other truth than conformity to preconceived ideas of the
characters of the gods. As evidence of what Plato regarded
as the origin of the religious beliefs which were held by
his contemporaries, his "Republic" is an important testimony;
for he assigns almost nothing to mankind in general,
but an emotional tendency to believe in invisible
quasi-human agents, of whom they had no definite conceptions,
and at the same time they were entirely ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
of recorded history, past and present. They needed distinct
legendary fictions and invented narratives; these were
furnished to them by those who could coin them, and were
accepted upon the authority of those who promulgated
them. Those who first embodied the fictions as narratives
were the oldest poets; in progress of time the authority
which dictated belief in them came to be the state. Plato
rejected the fictions of the state, and in his "Republic"
proposed to substitute fictions of his own. The testimony
of Plato, therefore, in respect to the origin of religious beliefs
in the early ages of Greece is decidedly against the
ghost-theory, whatever support may be found for that
theory in the beliefs of the uncivilized races of our own
day, or in the beliefs of other nations of antiquity. But
neither the ghost-theory, as the origin of beliefs in supernatural
beings, nor the origin of such beliefs in the will
of the lawgiver, which Plato clearly held in his "Republic"
to be the foundation of orthodoxy, is any test or measure
of what philosophy may attain to as a rational conception
at the present day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>I propose, therefore, to imagine a man of mature years,
without any religious prepossessions whatever, a perfectly
independent thinker, furnished with the knowledge that is
now within the easy reach of human acquisition, capable
of correct reasoning, and with no bias to any kind of belief.
It is only necessary to personify in one individual the intellectual
capacity of the cultivated and educated part of
mankind, but without the religious ideas instilled into
them by education, in order to have a valuable witness to
the mental processes and results which can be followed and
attained by a right employment of our faculties. And, the
better to exhibit the processes and results, I propose to let
this imaginary person discuss in the form of dialogue, in
which another imaginary interlocutor shall be a modern
disciple of the evolution school, whatever topics would be
likely to come into debate between such persons.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>
</div>


<p class="intro">The existence, attributes, and methods of God deducible from the phenomena
of Nature&mdash;Origin of the solar system.</p>


<p>In all that has been said in the preceding chapters respecting
the two hypotheses of special creation and evolution, the
existence and attributes of the Supreme Being have been
assumed. The question of the existence and attributes of
God has been reserved for discussion as an independent inquiry;
and this inquiry it is now proposed to make, without
any reference to the teachings of revealed religion, or
to the traditionary beliefs of mankind. The simple idea of
God, which I suppose to be capable of being reached as a
philosophical deduction from the phenomena of the universe,
embraces the conception of a Supreme Being existing
from and through all eternity, and possessed of the attributes
of infinite power and goodness, boundless, that is to
say in faculties, incapable of error, and of supreme beneficence.
While this idea of God corresponds with that which
has been held from an early period under more or less of the
influence exerted by teachings which have been accepted
as inspired, or as authorized by the Deity himself, the question
here to be considered is whether the same idea of God
is a rationally philosophical deduction from the phenomena
of the universe without the aid of revelation.</p>

<p>In order to conduct this inquiry so as to exclude all influence
of traditionary beliefs derived from sources believed
to have been inspired, or from any authority whatever, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
us suppose a man to have been born into this world in
the full maturity of average human faculties, as they are
found in well-disciplined intellects of the present age, but
without any inculcated ideas on religious subjects. In the
place of education commencing in infancy and carried on
to the years of maturity, in the course of which more or
less of dogmatic theology would have become incorporated
almost with the texture of the mind, let us suppose that
the mind of our inquirer is at first a total blank in respect
to a belief in or conception of such a being as God, but
that his intellectual powers are so well developed that he
can reason soundly upon whatever comes within the reach
of his observation or study. Let us further imagine him
to be so situated that he can command at will the knowledge
that science, as it now exists, could furnish to him,
and that he is able to judge impartially any theories with
which he meets. Such a person would be likely to deal
rationally and independently with any question that might
arise in the course of his investigations; and the fundamental
question that would be likely to present itself to his
mind would be, How came this universe and its countless
phenomena to exist?</p>

<p>Stimulated by an eager curiosity, but careful to make
his investigations with entire coolness of reasoning, let us
suppose that our inquirer first turns his attention to the
phenomena of the solar system, and to what astronomy can
teach him in regard to its construction. He finds it to
consist of&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The sun, a great central body giving forth light and
heat.</p>

<p>2. A group of four interior planets: Mercury, Venus, the
Earth, and Mars.</p>

<p>3. A group of small planets, called asteroids, revolving
beyond the orbit of Mars, and numbering, according to the
latest discoveries, about two hundred and twenty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>4. A group of four planets beyond the asteroids: Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>

<p>5. The satellites of the planets, of which there are
twenty now known; all but three of them belonging to
the outer planets.</p>

<p>6. An intermediate number of bodies called comets and
meteors, which revolve in very eccentric orbits.</p>

<p>This system of bodies, constituting a mechanism by itself,
apart from what are called the fixed stars, is the first
object in nature to which our inquirer directs his studies.
Inasmuch as the comets and meteors move in very eccentric
orbits, and are supposed to come into our system from
the illimitable spaces beyond it, although in the case of the
comets, or some of them, mathematical calculations enable
astronomers to predict their return when they have
passed out of the solar system, and inasmuch as the sun
and the superior planets may be contemplated as a grand
piece of mechanism, and as the greatest mechanical object
in nature of whose construction and movements we have
some accurate knowledge, we will suppose that our inquirer
confines his attention to this part of the solar system, without
adverting to the action of the bodies which are not always,
as these are, within the range of the telescope.</p>

<p>One of the first things that would strike him would be
the enormous range in the sizes, distances, and relative
weights of these different bodies. He would learn, for example,
that Neptune is eighty times as far from the sun as
Mercury, and that Jupiter is several thousand times as
heavy; and he would observe that these differences in magnitude,
distance from the sun, and weight of each mass, are
carried through a range of proportions stupendously great.
If he followed the best lights of modern astronomy, he
would learn that what is known, or accepted as known, in
regard to the operation of any law among these bodies, is
that they are bound together by the law of universal gravi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>tation
as a force to which all matter would be subjected
when it should come to exist, in whatever forms it might
be distributed; secondly, that when the bodies now composing
the solar system should come into existence, the
system would not owe its proportions to the operation of
the law of gravitation, but would be the result of a plan so
shaped as to admit of its being governed by the law of
gravitation after the system had been made, in such a manner
as to produce regularity and certainty of movement
and to prevent dislocation and disturbance. What the great
modern telescopes have enabled astronomers to discover
tends very strongly to show that the plan of the solar system,
in respect to the relative distances, magnitudes, and
revolutions of the different bodies around the sun, and
their relations to that central body and to each other, are
not the result of any antecedent law which gradually
evolved this particular plan, but that the plan itself was
primarily designed and executed as one on which the law
of gravitation could operate uniformly, and so as to prevent
any disturbance in the relations of the different bodies
to each other.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>An illustration will help to make the meaning of this
apparent. Let us suppose a human artificer to project the
formation of a complex mechanism, in which different
solid bodies would be made to revolve around a central
body; and let us imagine him to be situated outside of the
earth's attraction, so that its attraction would not disturb
him. He would then have to consider the law of gravitation
only in reference to its operation among the different
bodies of his machine; and he would adjust their relative
distances, weights, and orbits of revolution around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
central body, so that the law of gravitation, instead of producing
dislocation and disturbance, would bind the whole
together in a fixed system of movement, by counteracting
the centrifugal tendency of a revolving body to depart
from its intended orbit, and at the same time relying on
the effect of the two forces in preventing the revolving
bodies from falling into the center or from rushing off into
the endless realms of space.</p>

<p>This is what may well be supposed to have taken place
in the formation of the solar system, for it is consistent
with the law which must have preceded the existence of
that system. We can not suppose that the law of gravitation
was itself a mere result of the relative distances, magnitudes,
and orbits of the different bodies. This supposition
would make gravitation not a law, but a phenomenon.
We do indeed arrive at the existence of the law of gravitation
by observing the actions of the bodies which compose
the solar system; in other words, we discover the law that
holds them together, by observing their actions. But we
should entirely reverse the proper process of reasoning, if
we were to conclude that the law of gravitation is a phenomenon
resulting from an arrangement of certain bodies
according to a certain plan. The discoveries of astronomy,
on the contrary, should lead us to regard gravitation as a
universal law, which existed before the existence of the
bodies which have been subjected to it. This is the only
way in which our inquirer could reason in regard to the
formation of the solar system, whether he supposed its
plan to have been a special creation, or to have been evolved
out of a nebulous vapor by the operation of the laws of
motion or any other laws. Reasoning upon the hypothesis
that the law of gravitation existed before there were any
bodies for it to operate upon, or, in other words, that it had
become in some way an ordained or established principle by
which all bodies would be governed, he would have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
means of understanding the adaptation of the solar system
to be operated upon by the law which he had discovered.</p>

<p>He would next ask himself, How came this law of
gravitation to exist? That it must have had an origin,
must have proceeded from some lawgiver competent to
make and enforce it, would be a conclusion to which he
would be irresistibly led, for the very idea of a law implies
that it is a command proceeding from an authority and
power capable of ordaining and executing it. When it is
said that a law is a rule of action ordained by a supreme
power, which is perhaps the most familiar as it is the most
exact definition, the idea of a command and of a power to
enforce it is necessarily implied. This is just as true of a
physical as it is of a moral law; of a law that is to govern
matter as of a law that is to govern moral and accountable
beings. Both proceed from a supreme authority and
power, and both are commands. There is, however, one
distinction between a moral law and a law of Nature, which
relates to the mode in which we arrive at a knowledge of
the law; a distinction which our inquirer would learn in
the course of his investigations. We infer the existence of
a law of Nature, or a law designed to operate upon matter,
from the regularity and uniformity of certain physical phenomena.
As the phenomena occur always in the same way
we infer it to be an ordinance of Nature that they shall occur
in that way. But the moral phenomena exhibited by
the actions of men have not this regularity and uniformity.
They are sometimes in accordance with and sometimes
grossly variant from any supposed rule of moral action.
We can not, therefore, deduce a moral law from our observation
of the actions of the beings whom it was designed
to govern, but we must discover it from the rules of right
reason and from such information as has been given to us
by whatever revelation may have come to us from another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
source than our own minds. But this distinction between
the modes of reaching a knowledge of physical and moral
laws does not apply to the authority from which they have
proceeded. Both of them being commands, or fixed rules
of action, both must have had an enacting authority. We
learn the one by observing the phenomena of Nature. We
learn the other from reason and revelation.</p>

<p>To return now to the examination of the solar system,
which our inquirer is supposed to be prosecuting. The
study, which astronomy and its implements will have enabled
him to make, has taught him the existence of the
law of gravitation, and has led him to the conclusion that
it must have had an enacting authority. Following out the
operation of this law, through the stupendous spaces of the
solar system, he would begin to form conclusions respecting
the attributes of its author. He would see that the power
must have been superhuman; in other words, that it must
have immeasurably transcended anything that can be imagined
of power wielded by a being of less than infinite
capacities; for, although the space occupied by the solar
system, from the central sun out to the orbit of the planet
Neptune, is a measurable distance, the conception of the
law of gravitation, and its execution, through such an
enormous space and among such a complex system of bodies,
evince a faculty in the lawgiver that must have been boundless
in power and skill. The force of gravitation is found
to exactly balance the centrifugal tendency of the bodies
revolving around the sun, so that, when once set in motion
around that center, they remain in their respective orbits
and never fall into the sun or into each other. Our learner
would thus see the nature of the adjustment required to
produce such a result; and, even if he endeavored to follow
out this balancing of forces no farther than to the extreme
boundary of the solar system, he would see that the being,
who could conceive and execute such a design on such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
scale, must have had supreme power and boundless intelligence.
So that, by the study of the solar system, as its
arrangements and movements are disclosed by astronomy,
our inquirer would be naturally led to the conception of a
lawgiver and artificer of infinite power and wisdom, ordaining
the law of gravitation to operate against the centrifugal
force, which would otherwise conduct out of its orbit
a body revolving around a center, and then adjusting the
relative distances, weights, and revolutions of the different
bodies, so as to subject them to the operation of the great
law that is to preserve them in fixed relations to each other.</p>

<p>If, next, our inquirer should go farther in his investigations
of the solar system, and endeavor to satisfy himself
concerning the mode in which the different bodies of this
system came into existence in their respective positions, the
history of astronomy would teach him that there has been a
theory on this subject which fails to account for the existence
of this system of bodies without the hypothesis of some
special creation. This theory is what is called the nebular
hypothesis. It supposes that the solar system was evolved
out of a mass of fiery vapor, which filled the stellar spaces,
and which became the bodies now observable by the telescope,
and that they were finally swung into their respective
places by the operation of the fixed laws of motion. But
all that astronomers now undertake to say is that this hypothesis
is a probably true account of the origin of the solar
system, and not that it is an established scientific fact, or
a fact supported by such proofs as those which show the
existence of the laws of motion. The history of the nebular
hypothesis, from the time of its first suggestion to the present
day, shows that there are no satisfactory means of accounting
for the method in which the supposed mass of
fiery vapor became separated, consolidated, and formed
into different bodies, and those bodies became ranged and
located in their respective positions. The hypothesis that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
these results were all produced by fixed laws working upon
a mass of fiery vapor, is one that has been reasoned out in
very different ways; and this diversity of views is such that
astronomers of the higher order do not undertake to say that
opinions may not reasonably differ in regard to the principal
question, namely, the question between the nebular
hypothesis and the hypothesis of a special act or acts of
creation.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, therefore, as scientific astronomy would present
to our inquirer nothing but the nebular hypothesis to
account for the production of the bodies of the solar system
as they now exist, and as there are admitted difficulties in
this hypothesis which may not be insurmountable but which
have not been as yet by any means overcome, it can not be
said that philosophers are warranted in assuming that all
the phenomena of the solar system are to be explained by
this theory. The hypothesis that the phenomena, or some
part of them, have been produced by a cause operating in
a different way, that is, by an act or acts of intentional and
direct or special creation, is not excluded by the discoveries
of the astronomer. Those discoveries lie in the domain of
astronomy, and they do not exclude the hypothesis of a
special creation of the solar system upon the plan on which
we find it arranged. The latter hypothesis lies in the domain
of philosophy. It is to be judged by the inquiry
whether it is a rational explanation of phenomena, which
astronomy does not show as an established scientific fact,
or by proofs that ought to be deemed satisfactory, to have
been produced by the method suggested by the nebular hypothesis.</p>

<p>The philosophic reasoning, which would conduct our
inquirer to his conclusions, would begin for him with the
existence of an omnipotent being, by whom the laws of
matter and motion were established. This conception and
belief he has attained from having discovered those laws,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
which must have had an author. He would soon hear the
scientist speak of "natural" and "supernatural" methods,
and he would understand that by the former is meant the
operation of certain fixed laws, and, by the latter, a mode
of action in a different way. But he would also and easily
understand that the power which could establish the laws
of matter and motion, the operation of which the scientist
calls the natural method, could equally act in another way,
which the scientist calls the supernatural, but which, in
the eye of philosophy, is just as competent to the Infinite
Power as the method called natural. To state it in different
words, but with the same meaning, that which the
scientist calls the supernatural is to the philosopher just as
conceivable and just as consistent with the idea of a supreme
being as the order of what we call Nature; for Nature is
the phenomena that are open to our observation, and from
which we deduce the probable method by which they have
been brought about. It will never do to say that they could
not have been produced by a cause operating differently
from a system of fixed laws so long as we reason from the
hypothesis of the existence and attributes of a Supreme
Being. If we reason without that hypothesis, we may persuade
ourselves of anything or of nothing.</p>

<p>This idea of a Supreme Being, possessed of the attributes
of infinite power and wisdom, is one that our inquirer
would have reached as a rational deduction from the operation
of a law (gravitation) which must have had an author;
from the structure of a mechanism so designed as to be
governed successfully by that law, and from the execution
of the law through such enormous spaces that nothing
short of infinite power and wisdom could have produced
the result.</p>

<p>At this stage of his investigations, our inquirer encounters
a modern scientist. I shall take the liberty of
coining convenient names for these two interlocutors: call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>ing
the one Sophereus, as representing the spirit of unprejudiced
research in the formation of beliefs without the
influence of previous teaching; and the other Kosmicos, as
a representative of the dogmatic school of evolution and
agnosticism.</p>

<p>Sophereus has imparted to his scientific friend the conclusions
which he has thus far reached, concerning the existence
and attributes of a supreme lawgiver and artificer,
as deduced from the phenomena of the solar system. The
discussion between them then proceeds as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I do not wish to convince you at present of
my own views on this subject, but I put before you a difficulty
which you ought to solve, if you can, to your own satisfaction,
before you proceed farther. You have learned of the
law of gravitation; and you have imagined a being who
has established this and other laws by which matter is to be
governed. To this being you have imputed certain personal
attributes, which you call infinite power and boundless
wisdom. Observe now that the laws to which you
assign this origin are of perpetual duration; they have
operated without change from the remotest period of their
existence just as they operate now, and we have no reason
to doubt that they will continue to operate in the same way
through the indefinite future. They constitute the order
of Nature. Now, you suppose a Supreme Being, who has
established these invariable laws, but has not left them
anything to do; has not left to them the production of the
solar system, but has specially interposed, and in a supernatural
mode of action has constructed the machine which
has the sun for its center and the surrounding bodies which
revolve about it. How can you suppose that the same being
has acted in different ways? How can you suppose
that the being who you imagine established the general
laws of Nature and gave to them a fixed operation throughout
the universe, so that they never would be suspended or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
interrupted, has gone aside from them, and made occasional
constructions by special interpositions of his power? Is it
not a contradiction to suppose that an Almighty Being, who
must have acted by uniform methods without reference to
occasions, has acted on certain occasions by special methods
that were not uniform with his fixed laws? Does not this
hypothesis imply that his fixed laws were insufficient for
the purposes for which he designed them, and that he had
to resort to other means? How do you get over this difficulty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> What you propound as a difficulty does not
disturb me. I understand the distinction which you make
between the natural and the supernatural. I can see in the
solar system how the law of gravitation and all the other laws
of motion operate; but I do not see, nor can you explain,
how these laws, or the laws of chemical combination or any
other laws, can have evolved the plan of the solar system
out of a mass of fiery vapor. I can understand the enactment
and establishment of laws of motion, of chemical combination,
and of the mechanical action of different states of
matter upon each other, to operate in fixed and invariable
ways, in certain conditions. But I do not see that there is
any interruption or displacement of these laws, after they are
established, when an end that is to be accomplished calls for
a complex system of new objects among which they are to
operate. It is manifest that the question is whether the different
bodies of the solar system have been formed and placed
in their respective positions, according to a special design of
their relative distances, magnitudes, and orbits, or whether
these are the results of the operation of fixed laws, without
any special interposition of a creating power. Astronomers
have not explained how the latter hypothesis is anything
more than a probable conjecture. It remains for me
to consider whether the hypothesis of a special interposition,
whereby the plan of the solar system has been made, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
attended with the difficulty which you suggest. We are
reasoning about a period of the remote past when this
system of bodies did not exist, but when the general laws
that were to govern all matter may be supposed to have
been previously ordained. If we think of the solar system,
conceived and projected by the Supreme Being, as a complex
mechanism that was to exist in Nature, the occasion
would be one calling for the exercise of infinite wisdom and
power. The production of such a mechanism, to answer
any ends for which it was intended that it should exist, implies
attributes that transcend all our human experience of
the qualities of power and wisdom. That it was an occasional
exercise of power, in no way implies any irregularity
or inconsistency of method, if the power was so exercised
as to leave all the general laws of Nature in full operation,
so that there would be no clashing between what you call
the natural and the supernatural. I have first to ascertain
what was the probably intended scope of the general laws
which are supposed to have been ordained before the solar
system came into existence. If it appears to have been
the purpose of the constructor to have these laws work
out this system of bodies without any special interposition
and formative skill directly exercised, I need go no further.
But I see no evidence of that purpose. No one has
suggested anything but a theory on this subject, which
is not supported by any satisfactory proofs. I am left,
therefore, to the consideration of the question whether an
act of special interposition, in the formation of a plan obviously
calling for the exercise of infinite wisdom and power,
is in any way inconsistent with the establishment of a system
of laws which were to operate on these bodies and
among them after they had come to exist. My conclusion,
from what I have learned of the solar system, is, that in
the exercise by the same being of the method which you
call the natural, and the exercise of the method which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
call the supernatural, there is no inconsistency; that each
of the fixed laws of matter and motion was designed to have
its own scope; and that each of them may well consist,
within its limitations, with occasional exercises of power,
for the production of objects that were to be operated upon
by the laws, but of which they were not designed to be the
producing cause. Thus it seems to me to be a rational
conclusion that the law of gravitation, the general laws of
motion, and all the other laws of matter, which preceded
the existence of the solar system, were not designed to be
the agents by which the plan of that system would be
worked out, but that the plan was so formed and executed
that the bodies composing it would be subject to the operation
of laws enacted by the Infinite Will for the government
of all the forms of matter. The question is, whether the
plan of the solar system is due to the operation of the fixed
laws, or to a special interposition; or, to state it in another
way, whether the whole of the phenomena, the plan
and arrangement of the solar system included, are to be
referred to the operation of certain fixed laws as the producing
agents, or whether some part of the phenomena,
namely, the mechanism of the system, should be referred to
the special interposition. I am taught, by the physics on
which astronomers are now agreed, that gravitation is a
force by which the particles of matter act on each other;
<em>that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every
other particle with a force varying directly as their masses,
and inversely as the square of the distance which separates
them</em>. This I understand to be the formula in which the
law of universal gravitation is expressed. But, for the purpose
of illustrating what I understand to be the operation
of this force, I have constructed a diagram, in which two
bodies are represented as A and B. From each of these
bodies there radiates in all directions an attracting force,
which acts directly upon every other body in the universe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
and which is represented
in the diagram by dotted
lines. In the diagram,
the bodies A and B are
first supposed to be one
thousand miles apart. A
certain portion of the attracting
rays proceeding
from A would strike directly
upon B. All the
other rays proceeding in
the same direction from
A would pass on either
side of B without striking
it. If B is removed
to the distance of two
thousand miles from A,
the sum total of the
attractive force which
A would exert upon B
would be diminished by
the square of the distance,
because B would
intercept just one fourth
of the number of rays
proceeding from A compared
with the number
which it intercepts when
the two bodies are only
one thousand miles apart;
and the rays which B
does not intercept would
pass along through the
realms of space, until
they encountered some other body, on which they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
exert a force that would follow the same law of diminution.
In the diagram, the two bodies A and B may be single particles
of matter or collections of particles; they are represented
as cubes; but the law of direct action of the attracting
force and the law of its diminution would be the same
if the bodies were spheres or oblongs. The power of attraction
which bodies exert upon each other resides in
every individual particle of matter composing the body,
and the attraction which that body exerts upon another
body is the sum total of the attractions which proceed from
all the particles composing the mass and which impinge
upon that other body.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus_p314.jpg"  alt="Diagram described in text" />
</div>

<p>In the diagram the two bodies A and B are supposed to
be of the same mass. If, as in the case of the sun and the
earth, one of the bodies is of far greater mass than the
other, then the attraction of the sun for the earth is the
same as the attraction of the earth for the sun, because the
action is mutual; but the sun, being the greater mass,
tends, by reason of its correspondingly greater inertia, to
remain comparatively stationary, or, in other words, it has
a greater resistance to being pulled out of its normal position,
while the earth, having less inertia, is more easily
deflected from its straight course in which its momentum
tends to carry it, and so travels in an orbit around the sun,
the resisting or centrifugal pull of the earth, due to its inertia,
exactly balancing the inward pull due to the mutual
attraction. I understand that, besides the law of universal
gravitation, there are two fundamental laws of motion. By
one of these laws, if a body be set in motion and be acted
on by no other than the projectile force, it will move forward
in a straight line and with a uniform velocity forever.
But by another law, if the moving body is acted on
by another force than that which originally projected it in
a straight line, it will deviate from that line in the direction
of that other force and in proportion to it. If A,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the earth, liable to be drawn toward B, the sun, by their
mutual attraction, was originally projected into space, at
a certain distance from the sun, by a force which would
carry it on in a straight line, it would be acted on by two
forces: the projectile force would cause it to move in a
straight line; the force of the mutual attraction would
cause it to deviate from that line in the direction of the
sun. The result would be that the earth would be carried
around the sun in a circular or an elliptical orbit. Every
other planet in the solar system would be under the operation
of the same compound forces governed by the same
laws; and while the sun would exert upon each of them
its force of attraction, and they would each exert upon the
others an attractive force that would be diminished by the
squares of their distances from one another, each of them
would be deflected from the straight line that would have
otherwise been the path of its motion, and the result would
be a perpetual revolution around the body that could exert
upon each just the amount of attraction requisite to overcome
the projectile force by which it was first put in motion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You have made an ingenious explanation
of the law of gravitation, which may or may not be correct.
But now let me understand what you infer from
this hypothesis, supposing it to be true. What should
have prevented the law of gravitation and the laws of
motion from working out this very system of bodies, by
operating upon a mass of crude matter lying in the universe,
supposing it to have been fiery vapor or anything
else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I have thus far arrived, by the aid of what
astronomy teaches, at a complex system of physical laws,
the law of universal gravitation, and the laws of motion.
I must suppose that these laws had an intelligent author.
I must suppose that they were enacted, in the same sense
in which we speak of any rule of action ordained by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
power competent to conceive of it and to put it into execution.
To me, as I view the facts of the solar system, the
idea that the law of gravitation and the laws of motion are
to be regarded as mere phenomena of matter, or as qualities
of matter according to which, from some inherent
condition, it must act, does not explain the solar system.
I can not explain to myself what I see, without asking
myself how these qualities of matter came to exist. How
came it to be a condition of all matter that its particles
should attract each other by a certain force according to a
certain rule? How came it to be a law of motion that
bodies projected into space should continue to move on
forever in a straight line, unless deviated from that line by
some other force? To say that things happen, but that
no power ever commanded them to happen; that things
occur because they do occur, and not because some power
has ordained that they shall occur, is to me an inconceivable
kind of reasoning, if it be reasoning at all. Because
men act or profess to act upon certain principles of moral
conduct, I can not suppose that justice, and truth, and
mercy are mere phenomena of human conduct, that they
never had any origin as moral laws in the will of a lawgiver.
For the same reason I can not suppose that the
physical laws of matter, stupendous in their scope, and of
unerring certainty in their operation, did not proceed from
an enacting authority. In short, it seems to me that the
conception of power, as something independent of the
qualities of substance, is a logical necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I am not now trying to persuade you that
the law of gravitation and the laws of motion did not have
an intelligent author. For the purposes of the argument,
I will concede that they were enacted, as you term it. You
have explained your understanding of the operation of these;
laws as they are expressed in the formula given by astronomers,
and for the present I will assume that they operate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
in some such way. I will also concede that the idea of
power in the abstract, as something independent of the
qualities of substance, is necessary to the explanation of all
physical phenomena. But I now recall your attention to
the point which I originally suggested. Explain to me
how it has happened that the being who you suppose established
certain laws for the government of all matter has
not allowed those laws to evolve out of diffused matter certain
bodies which we find grouped together in the universe,
but has specially interposed by another act, and constructed
this system of bodies without the agency of his own laws.
All that we know about the law of gravitation and the laws
of motion we derive from observing the actions of these
bodies which compose the solar system. We infer the existence
of these laws from the actions of these bodies. Now
tell me how you suppose that the same being who ordained
these laws as fixed conditions to which matter was to be
subjected, and made them to operate upon all matter,
whether in a crude and unformed state or after it had become
organized into bodies of definite shapes and dimensions,
did not rely upon these inherent conditions of matter
to produce those shapes and dimensions, but went to work
by special interposition, and produced the mechanism of
the solar system as a human artificer would make a machine
of a corresponding character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> We must take things in a certain order. I
understand you to concede, for the present, that the laws
of gravitation and motion must, or may, have existed before
the sun and the planets were formed. We are agreed, then,
that power has an existence anterior to and separate from
the qualities of substance. What, then, is the difficulty attending
the hypothesis that the Infinite Power, which devised
and established the laws of gravitation and motion
before the bodies of the solar system were formed, so fashioned
and distributed those bodies that while each of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
shall exert upon every other a certain amount of direct attraction,
that attraction shall diminish in a certain fixed
ratio, as the distance between them increases? We can not
suppose that the relative magnitudes, weights, and distances
of these bodies were accidental, or that they resulted
from the property of attraction that was given to the particles
of matter of which they are composed. That property
of mutual attraction became at some time a fixed condition
of all matter, but it will not account for the formation of a
system of bodies so adjusted that the attracting force will
act among them by a specific law, by the operation of which
they will be prevented from exerting on each other an excessive
amount of such force, or any amount but that which
is exactly needful to preserve their relative distances from
each other. Let it be supposed that the property of attraction
was impressed upon all the particles of matter in
the universe, and then that the Infinite Power, abstaining
from all farther action, and without forming and arranging
the bodies of the solar system upon any intentional plan,
left all that plan to be worked out by that property of matter;
what reason have we to conclude that the law of gravitation
would, as the sole efficient cause, have produced just
exactly this complex piece of mechanism, so wonderfully
adjusted? What reason have we to conclude that the property
of attraction, although ordained as an inherent quality
of all matter, would not, if left without any special interposition,
have resulted in some very different arrangement
and disposition of the matter lying in the space now occupied
by the solar system?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Give me your idea of the condition which is
called "chaos," and I will then explain to you why it is
that you do not do justice to the scientific distinction between
the natural and the supernatural method by which
things have been produced as we see them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I presume you do not mean to ask how I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
suppose chaotic matter came to exist. Its origin is one
thing&mdash;its condition is another. In regard to its condition,
it seems very plain that there was a period when diffused
matter had not received the impress of the qualities or been
subjected to the laws which we now recognize. Take the
Mosaic hypothesis, where it speaks of the earth, for example,
as "without form and void." In this terse expression,
there is embraced the idea of a condition of matter without
qualities, properties, or laws; lying in an utterly crude
state, waiting to receive the impress of the divine will.
The laws of motion have not begun to operate upon it; the
laws of chemical combination have not been applied to it.
It is a rational conclusion that this was the condition of
things in that remote period of eternity before the solar system
was formed. Chaos, then, was the condition of primeval
matter before it had received the fixed properties that
were afterward to belong to it, and before the laws that
were ever afterward to govern it had been ordained. Lying
in this utterly crude state, without tendencies, without
combinations, without definite motion, floating in the universe
without fixed form or qualities, it awaits the action
of the Infinite Power. It pleases that power, out of its illimitable
resources, to bestow upon this chaotic matter certain
properties, and to subject it to certain laws. One of
these properties is that its particles shall attract one another
by a certain force; one of these laws is that this force shall
operate by an invariable and fixed rule of direct action, and
by an invariable and fixed rule of diminution, according to
the distance of the particles from each other; and another
law is that a body projected into space, by any force,
shall continue to move in a straight line until and unless
it is deflected from that line by some other force. There
are, too, chemical properties belonging to matter as we
know it, by which it takes on certain combinations and
undergoes modifications and arrangements of its particles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
All these properties, qualities, and laws&mdash;these unavoidable
methods of action&mdash;must have been imposed upon the chaotic
matter at some time by a power competent to establish
them, and to put them in operation. But the laws and
the methods of their operation do not account for the <span class="smcap">PLAN</span>
on which the solar system has been formed, consisting of
different bodies of such shapes, dimensions, and relative
distances, that the laws, when applied to them, will produce
the wonderfully exact and perpetual movements which
the telescope reveals. That <span class="smcap">PLAN</span> is a <em>creation</em>, for which
we must look to something more than the laws and properties
of matter; and we can only find it in the will and purposes
of the infinite artificer who devised the laws by which
this mechanism was to be governed after it had been made,
and who has so made it that it would be governed by them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I do not see that you have yet reached a
stronger ground on which to rest the hypothesis of special
interposition than that on which is based the hypothesis
which imputes the formation of the solar system to certain
fixed laws operating upon crude matter not yet formed into
definite shapes or placed in certain relative positions. You
will have to adduce some proof that has a stronger tendency
to exclude the supposition that the mechanism of the solar
system was produced by the laws of matter and motion
working upon some material that lay in the condition which
you have described as "chaos."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Let us, then, look a little farther into some
of the details of this vast machine. Take one that is most
obvious, and that lies the nearest to us; I mean the moon,
which accompanies our earth as its satellite. The most remarkable
thing about the motion of the moon is the fact
that she makes one revolution on her axis in the same time
that she takes to revolve around the earth, and consequently
she always presents to us the same face, and her other side
is never seen by human eyes. How came this to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
case? How came this to be the adjustment of the two
motions, the axial revolution of the moon and her revolution
around the earth, causing her always to present to us
the same side? It is said by astronomers that the two motions
are so exactly adjusted to each other that the longer
axis of the moon always points to the earth, without the
slightest variation. It is conceded, as I understand, to be
infinitely improbable that this adjustment was the result of
chance. A cause for it is therefore to be found. Where
are we to look for that cause, unless we look for it in the
will and design of the Creator, who established it for some
special purpose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You are aware that there is a physical explanation
of this phenomenon which accounts for it without
the special design. This explanation is that the moon
was once in a partially fluid state, and that she rotated on
her axis in a period different from the present one. In
such a condition, the attraction of the earth would produce
great tides in the fluid substance of the moon; this attraction,
combined with the centrifugal force of the moon's
rotation on her own axis, would cause a friction, and this
friction would retard the rate of her axial rotation, until it
became coincident with the rate of her revolution around
the earth. It is highly improbable that the moon was
originally set in rotation on her axis with just the same velocity
with which she was made to revolve around the earth.
This improbability is based on the ellipticity of the moon's
orbit, which is caused by the attraction of the sun. The
mean distance of the moon from the earth is 240,300 miles;
her smallest possible distance is 221,000 miles; and the
greatest possible distance is 259,600. The usual oscillation
between these extremes is about 13,000 miles on each side
of the mean distance of 240,300. The diameter of the
moon is 2,160 miles, or less than two sevenths of the earth's
diameter. In volume she is about one fiftieth as large as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the earth, but her density, or the specific gravity of her
material, is supposed to be a little more than half of that
of our globe; and her weight is about three and a half times
the weight of the same bulk of water. When she is nearest
to the sun, the superior attraction of that body tends to
draw her out of her circular orbit around the earth; when
she is farthest from the sun, this attraction is diminished,
and thus her terrestrial orbit becomes slightly elliptical.
But there is another attraction to be taken into account.
This other attraction, in her former fluid condition, has
given her the shape, not of a perfect sphere, but of an ellipsoid,
or an elongated body with three unequal axes. The
shortest of her axes is that around which she rotates; the
next longest is that which points in the direction in which
she is moving; and the longest of all points toward the
earth. This shape of the moon, resulting from the earth's
attraction, has been produced by drawing the matter of the
moon which is nearest to the earth toward the earth, and
by the centrifugal force which tends to throw outward the
matter farthest from the earth. The substance of the
moon being a liquid, so as to yield freely, she would be
elongated in the direction of the earth. But if she was
originally set in motion on her own axis at precisely the
same rate with which she was made to revolve around the
earth, the correspondence between the two motions could
not have been kept up; her axial rotation would have varied,
by reason of the fact that her relative distance from the sun
and the earth varies with the ellipticity of her orbit around
the earth, and thus the two motions would not correspond.
But if we allow for the attraction of the earth upon a liquid
or semi-liquid body, producing for the moon an elongated
shape, her axial rotation would, if the two motions were in
the beginning very near together, vary with her revolutions
around the earth, and the correspondence between the two
motions would be kept up. Here, then, you have a physi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>cal
explanation of the phenomenon which strikes you as
so remarkable&mdash;a result brought about by natural causes,
without the supposition of what you call intentional design,
or formative skill directly exercised by a supernatural interposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> This is a very plausible theory, but it all
depends upon two assumptions: First, it assumes it to be
extremely improbable that the two motions were aboriginally
made to correspond, by an intentional adjustment of
the moon's weight, dimensions, and shape, upon such a
plan that the laws of gravitation and movement would keep
the two motions in exact correspondence. Why should not
the rates of movement have been originally designed and
put in execution as we find them? You anticipate the answer
to this question by another assumption, namely, that
the substance of the moon was at first in a fluid or semi-fluid
state, so that she owed her present shape to the effect
of the earth's attraction, and the centrifugal tendency of
its most distant part to be thrown out of the line of its motion.
I should be glad to have you explain why it is extremely
improbable that the Creator planned this part of
the solar system, the earth and its satellite, and so adjusted
the dimensions, shapes, and weights of each of them, and
fixed the rates of revolution of the satellite, that the laws
of attraction and motion would find a mechanism which
they would keep perpetually in operation, and thus preserve
a constant relation between the moon's axial rotation and
her revolution around the earth. I have thus far learned
to regard the probable methods of the Creator somewhat
differently from those which you scientists ascribe to him.
Most of you, I observe, have a strong tendency to regard
the Deity as having no specific plan in the production of
anything, which plan he directly executed; and, so far as
you regard a First Cause as the producing cause of phenomena,
you limit its activity to the establishment of certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
fixed laws, and explain all phenomena upon the hypothesis
that the Supreme Being&mdash;if you admit one&mdash;made no special
interpositions of his will and power in any direction, after he
had established his system of general laws. But to me it
seems that the weight of probability is entirely against your
hypothesis. In this particular case of which we have been
speaking, that of the moon's revolution, the supposed improbability
of an original and intentional adjustment of the
two motions turns altogether on the argument that if they
had been so adjusted at the beginning they would not have
kept on, and this argument is supported by the assumption
that the moon was at first a mass of fluid. I do not understand
this mode of making facts to support theories; and
I wish you would explain to me why, in this particular instance,
the inference of a divine and intentional plan in the
structure of this part of the solar system is so extremely
improbable. To me it seems so obvious a piece of invented
mechanism, that I can not avoid the conclusion that it was
the intentional work of a constructor, any more than I
could if I were to find a piece of mechanism under circumstances
which indicated that it was produced by human

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You do not even yet do justice to the scientific
method of reasoning. The deductions of science&mdash;the
conclusions which the scientist draws from the phenomena
of Nature&mdash;rest upon the postulate of fixed laws of
Nature, which never change, and which have not been varied
by any supernatural interference. We mean by a supernatural
cause one which is not uniformly in operation, or
which operates in some way different from the fixed laws
which we have deduced from the observed order of the phenomena
that we have studied and found to be invariable.
We adopt this distinction between the natural and the supernatural
because the observable phenomena of Nature do
not furnish any means of discovering as a fact the operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
of anything but the fixed laws, or any cause which has
acted in a different way. Let us now apply this to the
phenomena which we have been considering&mdash;the composition
and arrangement of the solar system. What do we
find? We find a system of bodies in the movements of
which we detect certain fixed laws operating invariably in
the same way. When the question is asked, How were these
bodies produced? we have no means of reaching a conclusion
except by reasoning upon the operation of the forces
which these laws disclose, working on the primordial matter
out of which the bodies became formed. It is for this
reason that, in accounting for their existence, we speak of
the method of their formation as the natural, in contradistinction
to some other method which we call the supernatural;
by which latter term we mean some mode in which
there has been a power exerted differently from the established
and fixed agency of the laws of matter, which constitute
all that we have ever discovered. The nebular hypothesis
affords a good illustration of the distinction which
I am endeavoring to show you, whether it is well established
or not, or is ever likely to be. It supposes that there was
a mass of fiery vapor, floating in the space now occupied
by the solar system. Under the operation of the laws of
gravitation and motion, of mechanical forces and chemical
combination, this crude matter becomes consolidated and
formed into the different bodies known to us as the sun and
the planets, and the laws which thus formed them continue
to operate to keep them in the fixed relations to each other
which resulted from the process of their formation. Whether
as a matter of fact the solar system was formed in this way,
this, or some other mode of operation through the action of
certain established laws operating upon primeval matter, is
what we call the natural method, in opposition to the supernatural;
and we can not discover the supernatural method,
because the closest and most extensive investigations never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
enable us to find in nature any method of operation but
that which acts in a fixed and invariable way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> What you have now said brings me to a
question that I have all along desired to ask you: How do
you know that the Infinite Power never acts, or never has
acted, in any way different from the established order of
Nature? Is science able to determine this? If it is not, it
must be for philosophy to consider whether there can have
been, or probably has been, in operation at any time any
cause other than those fixed laws of Nature which the scientist
is able to deduce from observable phenomena. Because
science can only discover certain fixed laws as the
forces governing the bodies which compose the solar system,
or governing the materials of which they are supposed to
be made, it does not seem to me that a philosopher is precluded
from deducing, by a proper method of reasoning
upon a study of the solar system, the probable truth that
its mechanism was specially planned and executed by a
special act of the creating power. The degree to which
this probability rises&mdash;whether it rises higher in the scale
than any other hypothesis&mdash;must depend upon the inquiry
whether any other hypothesis will better account for the
existence of this great object, with its enormous mechanism,
its adjustments, and its unerring movements. I must say,
from what I have learned of this planetary system, with the
sun as its center, viewed as a mechanism, that I can conceive
of no hypothesis concerning its origin and formation
which compares in probability with the hypothesis that it
was directly and specially created, as we know it, by the
Infinite Artificer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Pray, tell me what you mean by an act of
creation? Did you or any other man ever see one? Can
you tell what creation is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I think that your question can be answered.
Creation is the act of giving existence to something that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
did not previously exist. We see such acts performed by
men, very frequently, so that we do not hesitate to speak
of the product as a created thing. We do not see acts of
creation performed by the Infinite Power, but it is surely
not unphilosophical to suppose that what can be and is
done by finite human faculties, can be and has been done
by the infinite faculties of the Deity, and done upon a scale
and in a perfection that transcend everything that human
power has produced. The sense in which I have been led
to conceive of the solar system as a creation is the same as
that by which I represent to myself the production, by human
power and skill, of some physical object which never
existed before, such as a machine, a statue, a picture, a pyramid,
or an obelisk; any concrete object which, whether or
not new of its kind, did not as an individual object previously
exist. In weighing the probabilities as to the mode
in which the solar system came to exist, the reasons why
the idea of its special creation stands by far the highest in
the scale are these: 1. There must have been a period
when this great object in nature did not exist, and therefore
it must have been caused to exist. 2. The necessary
hypothesis of a causing power leads inevitably to the conclusion
that the power was adequate to the production of a
system of bodies so proportioned and arranged that they
would act on each other by certain fixed rules. 3. The
causing or creating power must have conceived the proportions
and arrangements of the different bodies as a plan,
and must have executed that plan according to the conception.
4. While as a theory we can represent to ourselves
that the causing power established certain laws of matter
and motion, which would by their fixed operation on crude
substances lying in the universe produce this system of
bodies without any preconceived and predetermined plan,
without any occasional or special interposition, yet that the
system, as we find it, is a product of such a nature as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
have called for and required the special interposition of a
formative will. For, if we proceed upon the hypothesis
that this enormous and exact mechanism was nothing but
the product of certain pre-established laws operating on
crude matter, without direct and special interposition exerted
in the execution of a formed design, we have to obtain
some definite conception, and to find some proof of a
method by which these laws can have operated to produce
this system of bodies exactly as we know them to be proportioned
and arranged. Astronomical science, and all
other science, has not discovered, or even suggested, any
method by which this result could have been brought about,
without a special act of creation in the execution of an
original design. On the other hand, the hypothesis of a
special interposition in the execution of a preconceived
plan of construction is the most rational, the most in accordance
with probability, because it best meets the requirements
of the case. These requirements were that the proportions,
arrangements, and relations of the different bodies
composing one grand mechanism, should be such that the
laws of gravitation and motion would operate upon and
among them so as to keep them in uniform and unvarying
movement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Very well. You have now come to the
end of your reasoning. Tell me, then, why it is not just
as rational a supposition that the Deity conceived of the
plan of the solar system as a product that would result,
and that he intended should result, from the operation of
his fixed laws of matter and motion, and then left it to the
unerring certainty of their operation to produce the mechanism
by the process of gradual evolution?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> The being who is supposed to hold and
exercise supreme power over the universe, holds a power
to execute, by direct and special creation, any design which
he conceives and proposes to accomplish. I am prepared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
concede that the process of gradual evolution can produce
and apparently has produced some results. But when we
are looking for the probable methods of the Deity in the
production of such a mechanism as the solar system, we
must recognize the superior probability of the direct
method, because the indirect method which you describe
as gradual evolution does not seem adequate to the production
of such a system of bodies. If we could obtain facts
which could have any tendency to show that, without any
special interposition, the mechanism of the solar system, or
any part of it, is a mere result of the working of the laws
of gravitation and motion upon a mass of crude matter, we
might yield assent to the probability of that occurrence.
But of course we have no such facts; we have nothing but
theories; and therefore there appears nothing to exclude
the probable truth of a special creation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> We shall not convince each other. You
have stated your conclusions concerning the solar system
fairly enough, and I have endeavored to answer them. But
now let me understand how you propose to apply them to
other departments of Nature, in which we have means of
closer investigation. You will find it very difficult, I imagine,
to maintain that every organism, every plant, animal,
fish, insect, or bird, is a special creation, or even that
man himself is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Let me state for myself just what my conclusions
are in regard to the solar system. You will then
know what the convictions are with which I shall come to
the study of other departments. I have arrived at the
conception of an Infinite Being having the power to create
anything that seems to him good; and I have experienced
no difficulty in conceiving what an act of creation is. I
have also reached the conviction that there is one great
object in Nature, the existence of which I can not account
for without the hypothesis of some special act of creation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Whether I shall find this to be the case in regard to every
other object in Nature, I can not now tell. Perhaps, as
many of these objects are nearer to us, and more within
our powers of investigation, the result may be different.
I shall endeavor to keep my mind open to the necessary
discriminations which facts may disclose. Possibly I may
find reason to reverse the conclusions at which I have
arrived in regard to the solar system, if I find that the
hypothesis of evolution is fairly sustained by other phenomena.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Newton, whose reasoning powers have certainly not been surpassed
by those of any other philosopher, ancient or modern, not only
deduced the existence of a personal God from the phenomena of Nature,
but he felt no difficulty in ascribing to the Deity those personal attributes
which the phenomena of Nature show that he must possess, because without
them "all that diversity of natural things which we find suited to different
times and places" could not have been produced. They could, he
reasons, "arise from nothing but the ideas and will of a Being necessarily
existing." Newton does indeed say that all our notions of God are taken
from the ways of mankind; but this is by way of allegory and similitude.
There is a likeness, but not a perfect likeness. There is therefore no
necessity for ascribing to God anthropomorphic attributes, because the
enlargement of the faculties and powers to superhuman and boundless
attributes takes them out of the category of anthropomorphic qualities and
capacities. In his "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,"
Newton had occasion to treat of the theory of vortices, as a hypothesis by
which the formation of the solar system is to be explained. The "General
Scholium," by which he concludes the third book of his "Principia," lays
down the masterly reasoning by which he maintains that the bodies of the
solar system, while they persevere in their orbits by the mere laws of
gravity, could by no means have at first derived the regular position of the
orbits themselves from those laws. I had written the whole of the preceding
chapter on the origin of the solar system just as I have printed it,
before I looked into the "Principia" to see what confirmation might be
derived from Newton's speculations. I found that while I had not included
the comets in my examination of the solar system, but had confined myself
to the bodies that are at all times within the reach of the telescope, the
same deductions are re-enforced by the comets, eccentric as are the orbits
through which they range into and out of our system. I quote the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Scholium, as given in Motte's English translation of the "Principia" from
the Latin in which Newton wrote, published with a Life by Chittenden, at
New York, in the year 1848.</p></blockquote>


<h3>"GENERAL SCHOLIUM.</h3>

<p>"The hypothesis of vortices is pressed with many difficulties.
That every planet by a radius drawn to the sun
may describe areas proportional to the times of description,
the periodic times of the several parts of the vortices should
observe the duplicate proportion of their distances from
the sun; but that the periodic times of the planets may
obtain the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from
the sun, the periodic times of the parts of the vortex ought
to be in the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances.
That the smaller vortices may maintain their lesser revolutions
about <em>Saturn</em>, <em>Jupiter</em>, and other planets, and
swim quietly and undisturbed in the greater vortex of the
sun, the periodic times of the parts of the sun's vortex
should be equal; but the rotation of the sun and planets
about their axes, which ought to correspond with the motions
of their vortices, recede far from all these proportions.
The motions of the comets are exceedingly regular, are
governed by the same laws with the motions of the planets,
and can by no means be accounted for by the hypothesis
of vortices; for comets are carried with very eccentric
motions through all parts of the heavens indifferently,
with a freedom that is incompatible with the notion of a
vortex. Bodies projected in our air suffer no resistance
but from the air. Withdraw the air, as is done in Mr.
<em>Boyle's</em> vacuum, and the resistance ceases; for in this void
a bit of fine down and a piece of solid gold descend with
equal velocity. And the parity of reason must take place
in the celestial spaces above the earth's atmosphere; in
which spaces, where there is no air to resist their motions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
all bodies will move with the greatest freedom; and the
planets and comets will constantly pursue their revolutions
in orbits given in kind and position, according to the laws
above explained; but though these bodies may, indeed,
persevere in their orbits by the mere laws of gravity, yet
they could by no means have at first derived the regular
position of the orbits themselves from those laws.</p>

<p>"The six primary planets are revolved about the sun in
circles concentric with the sun, and with motions directed
toward the same parts, and almost in the same plane. Ten
moons are revolved about the earth, Jupiter, and Saturn, in
circles concentric with them, with the same direction of
motion, and nearly in the planes of the orbits of those
planets; but it is not to be conceived that mere mechanical
causes could give birth to so many regular motions, since
the comets range over all parts of the heavens in very eccentric
orbits; for by that kind of motion they pass easily
through the orbits of the planets, and with great rapidity;
and in their aphelions, where they move the slowest, and
are detained the longest, they recede to the greatest distances
from each other, and thence suffer the least disturbance
from their mutual attractions. This most beautiful
system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed
from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful
Being. And if the fixed stars are the centers of other
like systems, these being formed by the like wise counsel,
must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially
since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with
the light of the sun, and from every system light passes
into all the other systems; and lest the systems of the fixed
stars should, by their gravity, fall on each other mutually,
he hath placed those systems at immense distances one from
another."</p>

for a conception of a personal actor&mdash;Mr. Spencer's protoplasmic
origin of all organic life&mdash;The Mosaic account of creation
treated as a hypothesis which may be scientifically contrasted with
evolution.</p>


<p>A long interval has elapsed since the conference described
in the last chapter, between the searcher after wisdom
and his scientific friend. At their next interview they
take up the subject of a First Cause where they left it at
the conclusion of their debate on the solar system.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Well, Sophereus, what have you been studying
since we last met?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Many things. I have been studying what
is commonly called Nature, and I have been studying society.
With regard to society, I have been endeavoring to
discover to what the phenomena of social life are to be attributed
as their producing cause or causes; whether they
can be said to owe their existence to the direct action or
influence of intelligent wills, or are to be considered as
effects produced in the course of an ungoverned development,
wrought by incidental forces in varying conditions
of human existence. The latter, I find, is one of the theories
now prevailing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> And what is your conclusion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> My general conclusion in regard to the
phenomena of human society is the same as that which I
formed from a study of the phenomena of the solar system.
I find a great many things which I can not explain without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the hypothesis of a direct creating power exerted by an intelligent
being. I know that you object to the idea of creation,
but I explained to you in our last discussion that I
understood it to mean the causing something to exist which
did not exist before, and the doing it by an intentional and
direct act of production.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> No matter about your definition. What are
the facts that you propose to discuss?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> In the social phenomena I find many acts
of creation. I do not find that buildings spring out of the
ground without human intervention, or that machinery is
formed by the spontaneous arrangement of matter in certain
forms and relations, or by the tendencies that are implanted
in matter as its inherent properties. I find an
enormous multitude of concrete objects, formed out of dead
matter, by human intervention, availing itself of those properties
of matter, which without such active intervention
would have remained quiescent, and would not have resulted
in the production of these objects. It is a common
form of expression to speak of the "growth" of cities, but
no one understands by this form of speech that a city has
become what it is without the action of numerous individuals
projecting and building their separate structures, or
without the combined action of the whole body of the inhabitants
in determining and executing a general plan to
which individuals are to conform, more or less exactly, their
particular erections. Again, I find that there are rules of
social life, which take the form of what are called "laws,"
and these are imposed by the will of some governing authority;
they are always the product of some one human
will, or of the collective will of a greater number of persons.
I have looked into history and have found many instances
of military conquest, invasions of the territory inhabited
by one race of men by another race, domination of
different dynasties, overthrow of one governing power, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
substitution of another. Although the changes thus produced
are often very complex, sometimes rapid and sometimes
slow in reaching the consequences, I do not find that
they have ever taken place without the direct action of
some one human will, or of the aggregate force of many
human wills. The conquests of Alexander and Napoleon
are instances of what a single human will can do in changing
the condition of nations; and I have not been able to
read history by the interpretation that makes such men
mere instruments in the hands of their age, which would,
without their special existences and characters, have brought
about the same or something like the same results. The
invasions of the Roman Empire by the Northern barbarians
are instances of the pressure of one population upon another,
not attributable, perhaps, to the will and leadership of any
one individual, but produced by the united force of a great
horde of individuals determined to enjoy the plunder which
a superior civilization spread before them. Then, with regard
to the phenomena of what are called constitutions of
government, or the political systems of exercising public
authority, I find numerous cases in which the force of an
individual will and intelligence has been not only a great
factor, but by far the largest factor in the production of
particular institutions. The genius of Cæsar, and his extraordinary
constructive faculties, molded the institutions
of Rome in the most direct manner, and created an imperial
system that lasted for a thousand years, and that even out
of its ruins affected all subsequent European civilization.
In such cases, more than once repeated in modern times,
the particular circumstances of the age and the co-operation
of many other individuals have helped on the result, but the
conception, the plan, the purpose, and the execution, have
had their origin in some one mind. But for the individual
character, the ambition, the force, and the mental resources
of the first Napoleon, can one believe that the first French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
Empire of modern times would have grown out of the condition
of France? Suppose that Oliver Cromwell had
never lived. The protectorate, the system of government
which he gave to England, was the most absolute
product of the will and intellect of one man that the world
in that kind of product had ever seen; for, although the
people of England were ready for and needed that system,
and although the antecedent and the surrounding circumstances
furnished to Cromwell many materials for a political
structure that was not the old monarchy, and yet had while
it lasted all the vigor, and more than the vigor, of the old
monarchy, still, without his personal characteristics, his
ambition to found a dynasty on the wants of his country,
and his personal capacity to devise and execute such a system,
one can not believe that England would have had
what he gave her. What he could not give her was a son
capable of wielding the scepter which he had fashioned.
Here is this America of yours&mdash;a country in which, to a
certain extent, the political institutions have been influenced
by the circumstances that followed the separation of
your colonies from the English crown. Undoubtedly, your
ancestors of the Revolutionary epoch could not construct a
monarchy for the group of thirteen newly existing States,
each with its right and enjoyment of an actual autonomy.
The habits and genius of the people forbade the experiment
of monarchical or aristocratic institutions; no materials for
either existed. But within the range of republican institutions
there was a choice open, and the people exercised
that choice. They made one system of confederated States,
and found it would not answer. They then deliberately
assembled their wisest and greatest men. They gave to
them a commission that was restricted by nothing but the
practical necessity of framing a government that would
unite the requirements of power with the requirements of
liberty. The result was the Constitution of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
States&mdash;a system of government that was, within the limitations
of certain practical necessities, both in its fundamental
principles and in many of its details, the deliberate
choice and product of certain leading minds, aided by the
public consent, to a degree that is almost unparalleled in
the formation of political institutions. After it had gone
into operation, it was believed that the requirements of liberty
had not been sufficiently regarded, and it was directly
and purposely modified by the intervention of the collective
will of the whole people. And when I turn to the history
of philosophies, of religions, of the fine arts, or of the mechanical
arts, I find everywhere traces of the force of individual
genius, of the direct intervention of individual wills,
and of the power of men to cause new systems of thought
and action to come into existence, and to create new objects
of admiration or utility. In regard to languages, I have
read a good deal about the controversy concerning their
origin, but I have observed one thing to be very apparent:
whether the gift of articulate speech was bestowed on man,
when he had become a distinct being, in a manner and for
a purpose which would distinguish him from all the other
animals, or whether it became a developed faculty akin to
that by which other animals utter vocal sounds intelligible
to those of their species, it is certain that in man there is
a power of varying his vocal utterances at pleasure, which
is possessed by no other creature on this earth. The expansion
of languages, therefore, the coinage of new words,
the addition of new inflections, the introduction of new
shades of meaning, the method of utterance which is called
pronunciation, and the different dialects of the same tongue,
are all matters which have been under the control of individuals
dwelling together, and have all resulted from the
arbitrary determination of more or less numerous persons,
followed by the great mass of their nation, their race, or
their tribe. Even when a new and third language has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
formed by the contact of two peoples speaking separate
tongues, we may trace the same arbitrary adoption of parts
of each separate tongue, in the first beginning of the fusion,
and the new language consequently exhibits a greater or a
less predominance of the characteristics of one of its parent
tongues, according as the one population has compelled the
other to adopt the greater part of its peculiar modes of
speech.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You have gone over a good deal of ground,
but now what do you infer from all this, supposing that
you have taken a right view of the facts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I infer that, as in the social phenomena
there are products and effects which have owed their existence
to human will and direct human action, so, in
other departments, for example, in the domain which is
called Nature, and which is out of the sphere of human
agency and human force, it is reasonable to conclude that
there are products and effects which must have owed their
existence to a will and a power capable of conceiving and
producing them. And this is what leads me, as I was led
in the examination of the solar system, to the idea of a
Supreme Being, capable of producing those objects in nature
which are so varied, so complex, so marvelously constructed,
so nicely adapted to the conditions of each separate
organism, that if we attribute their existence to any
intelligent power, it must be to a power of infinite capacities,
since nothing short of such capacities could have conceived
and executed them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You have now come to the very point at
which I have been expecting to see you arrive, and at
which I will put to you this question: Why do you personify
the power to which you trace these products in the
natural world? Substitute for the term God, or the Creator,
the power of Nature. You then have a force that is
not only immense, but is in truth without any limit&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
force that embraces everything, gives life to everything, is
at once cause and effect, is incessantly active and inexhaustible.
It commands all methods, accomplishes all objects,
and uses time, space, and matter as its means. Why
do you personify this all-pervading and sufficient power of
Nature? Why make it a being, a deity, when all you
know is that it is a power? "Where wast thou when I
laid the foundations of the world?" is a question that God
is supposed to have asked of Job; and it simply shows that
Job had been traditionally taught to believe that there is
such a being as God, and that that being laid the foundations
of the world. Substitute Nature in the question, let
Nature ask the question, and it is just as pertinent, and involves
the same problem of human existence. Where was
man when Nature began to exhibit that power which has
evolved all things that we see out of the primeval nothingness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Well, here I must say that you have left
out certain ideas that are essential to all true reasoning on
this subject. Power without a guide, power without control,
power without a determining will, power that acts
without a volition which determines the how and the when,
is a thing that I can not conceive. I thought that in our
former conversation, when we were considering the solar
system, you conceded that power, as something abstracted
from substance or its properties, was a logically necessary
conception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I did. But I did not concede that power
must be converted into a person. You must not misunderstand
me. It certainly is my idea that power is a thing
to be contemplated by itself; and we are surrounded everywhere
by its manifestations. But it is not my idea that it
is held and exercised by the being called God, or by any
being. We only know of it by its effects; and these show
that Nature is, after all, both cause and effect, manner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
execution, design and product. You can go no farther.
You can not go behind Nature and find a being who sat
in the heavens and laid the foundations of the world, unless
you mean to accept a story which wise men have at
last abandoned along with many kindred beliefs which
came from the ages of the greatest ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Pardon me: the question that was put to
Job has more than one aspect. But I have considered the
narrative that is found in the first chapter of Genesis only
as a hypothesis to be weighed with other hypotheses of the
origin of the world and its inhabitants. I have studied the
phenomena to which you give the name of Nature, and I
will tell you what seems to me to be a postulate necessary
to be carried into that study. I have observed that in the
works of man two things are apparent: One is, that power
is exercised; the other is, that the exercise of the power is
always accompanied by a determining will, which decides
that the power shall be exerted, or that it shall be deferred,
or that it shall be applied variously as respects the mode
and the time. In human hands, power is not illimitable,
but within certain limitations it may be exercised, and it is
always under the guidance of a will. A man determines to
build a house; he decides on its dimensions, and when he
will begin to erect it. A general determines to attack the
enemy on a certain day, and he marshals his forces accordingly.
A people determine to change their government,
and they decide what their new government shall be. An
artist determines to paint a certain picture, and he paints
it. Whenever we see human power exercised, so that we
can connect product and power, the power itself is put in
motion by an intelligent will. I say, therefore, that the
idea of power without a controlling will, without a determining
design, is inconceivable: for I am obliged to draw my
conclusions from what I observe, and certainly the phenomena
of society do not present any instances of a product re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>sulting
from an exercise of power without a determination
to exercise it. Power diffused, power without guidance,
power moving by its own volition and without the volition
of any intelligent being, is not exhibited in the works of
man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> But we are now dealing with the works of
Nature; and the question is, whether the power that is
manifest in Nature is, to adopt your language, under the
control or guidance of a being who is something other than
the power itself. You must remember that this is a domain
in which you can see nothing but products and effects.
You must also remember that if the immensity and variety
of those products and effects lead to the conclusion that the
power transcends all human faculty, is superhuman, and, so
far as we can tell, boundless, all that we can know is that the
power itself is illimitable. The quality of an infinite and
illimitable capacity may be imputed to the power of Nature,
because a power without limit seems necessary to the production
of such effects as we see. But here we must stop.
We have no warrant for believing that the power which we
trace in the phenomena of Nature is held and controlled by
a person, as man holds and controls the power which he exercises
with his hands. What we see in Nature is the exercise
of an immense and apparently boundless power. But
the imputation of that power to a being distinct from the
power itself, is a mere exercise of the human imagination,
without any proof whatever. See how this imagination has
worked at different periods. Monotheism and polytheism
are alike in their origin. The one has imputed to different
beings all the phenomena in the different departments of
Nature, one being having the charge and superintendence
of one department and another being having another department.
Good and evil have thus been parceled out to
different deities or demons. On the other hand, monotheism
attributes all to some one being, and his existence is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
more rational than the existence of the whole catalogue of
the mythologies of all antiquity, or the stupid beliefs of the
present barbarous tribes. But Nature is a great fact, or
rather a vast store-house of facts, which we can study; and
what we learn from it is that there is a power which Nature
is constantly exerting, which is without any assignable limit,
which is itself both cause and effect, and beyond this we
can not go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Let us see if you are correct. In the first
place, do you not observe that the tendency of mankind to
personify the powers of Nature is one of the strongest proofs
of the logical necessity for an interpretation which seeks
for an intelligent being of some kind as the actor in the
production of the phenomena? It is the fashion, I find,
among a certain class of philosophers, to impute this propensity
to the proneness of the human mind toward superstitious
beliefs; to the mere effect of poetical or imaginary
temperament in certain races of men, or to fear in other
races; or to a vague longing for some superior being who
can sympathize with human sorrows or assist human efforts.
Something of all these influences has, no doubt, in different
degrees and in various ways, worked itself into the religious
beliefs of mankind. But neither any one of them, nor the
whole of them, will satisfactorily account for either polytheism
or monotheism. We must go deeper. There has
been an unconscious reasoning at work, more or less unconscious,
which has led to the conclusion that power, the
manifestation of power, necessarily implies that the power
is held and wielded by some intelligent being. The beliefs
of mankind, whether embracing one such being or many,
have not been the mere results of superstition, or fear, or
longing for divine sympathy, or for superhuman companionship
or protection. Those beliefs owe as much to the reasoning
powers of mankind as they do to the influence of imagination.
In many ages there have been powerful intel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>lects,
which have been free from the influence of superstition
or fancy, and which have recognized the logical necessity
for a conception of power as a force that must be under the
guidance and control of intellect. While the popular belief
has not attained this conviction by the same conscious and
logically conducted process of reasoning, it has been unconsciously
led through the same process, by what is open
to the observation of human faculties, even in the less civilized
portions of the human race. The savage who is sufficiently
raised above the brute creation to exercise his own
will and intelligence in the pursuit of his game, or in building
his wigwam, or in fighting his enemy, knows that he
exercises a power that is under his own control; and, as
soon as he begins to observe the phenomena of Nature, he
conceives of some being who holds a like power over the
material universe, and whom he begins to personify, to
propitiate, and to worship. This is the result of reasoning:
feeble in some cases, but in all cases the intellectual process
is the same. Now let us see whether this process is a sound
one. Are you sure that you are correct in saying that the
power of Nature is without limit? Is there a single force
in Nature, a single property of matter, or any sequence of
natural events, that is not circumscribed? Do not the
very regularity and uniformity of the phenomena of Nature
imply that some authority has said, from the beginning,
Thus far shalt thou go and no farther? You surely do not
imagine that the law of universal gravitation made itself,
or that it settled itself into an exact and invariable method
of action by the mere force of habit, beginning without prescribed
and superimposed limits, and finally resulting in a
fixed rule which never changes. You do not imagine that
the mysterious, impalpable motion to which is now given the
name of electricity, created for itself, as a matter of habit,
the perpetual tendency to seek an equilibration of the quantity
accumulated in one body with the quantity that is con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>tained
in another, by transmission through intermediate
bodies; or that it established for itself the conditions which
make one substance a better conducting medium than another.
You do not suppose, I take it, that certain particles of
matter adopted for themselves a capacity to arrange themselves
in crystals of certain fixed combinations and shapes,
and that other particles of matter did not choose to take on
this habit. All these forces, powers, and tendencies are of
very great extent, much beyond any that man can exercise;
but they all have their limitations, their prescribed and invariable
methods of action; they all act as if they have been
commanded to act in a certain way and to a certain extent,
and not as if they have chosen for themselves both method
and scope. Now, is it not a rational deduction that what is
really illimitable is not the power of Nature, but the power
which made Nature what it is? Is it not a necessary conclusion
that, inasmuch as all Nature acts within certain
limits, stupendous and minute and varied as the products
or effects may be, there must have been behind Nature a
power that could and did prescribe the methods, the limitations,
the lines within which Nature was to move and act?
You can not put into the mouth of Nature the question,
Where wast thou (Man) when I laid the foundations of the
world? without suggesting the retort, "Where wast <em>thou</em>
(Nature) when the foundations of the world <em>were</em> laid?"
And this question Nature can no more answer, for itself,
than man can answer for himself when the question is put
to him. Each must answer, I was nowhere&mdash;I did not exist.
Each must answer, There was a power which called me into
being, which prescribed the conditions of my existence,
which gave me the capacities that I possess, which ordained
the limitations within which I was to act.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> And all this you derive from the fact that a
being whom we call Man has some power over matter; that
he has an intelligent faculty by which he can do certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
things with matter, and that he actually does produce certain
concrete forms of new things that he did not find made
to his hand. Is this the basis of your reasoning about the
origin of Nature?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> It is, and I will tell you why. Man is the
one being on this earth in whom we find an intelligent will
and constructive faculty united, to a degree which shows
a power of variation and execution superior to that of all
other beings of whose actions we have the direct evidence
of our senses. We might select one or more of the inferior
animals, and find in them a strong constructive faculty;
but we do not find it accompanied by a power of variation
and adaptation that is equal to that of man in degree, or
that is probably the same in kind. I will not insist on the
distinction between reason and instinct, but I presume you
will admit that, when we compare the constructive faculty
of man and that of the most ingenious and wonderfully
endowed animal or insect, the latter acts always under an
implanted impulse, which we have no good ground for regarding
as of the same nature as man's reasoning power,
however striking may be the products. When, therefore,
we select the human power of construction or creation as
the basis of reasoning upon the works of Nature, we resort
to a being in whom that power is the highest of which we
have direct evidence. In the works of man we have direct
and palpable proof that the phenomena&mdash;the products of
human skill and human force&mdash;are brought about by the
faculties of an intelligent and reasoning being. If we dig
into the earth and find there a statue, an implement, or a
weapon, we do not hesitate to conclude that the spot was
once inhabited by men, just as surely as we should conclude
the same thing if we found there human bones. The world,
above-ground and below-ground, is full of concrete objects
that we know must have been fashioned by human skill,
guided by human intelligence. This intelligence, this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>tellect,
is not matter; it is a being; it is a person. It is
not a force, acting without consciousness; it is a being
wielding a force which is under the control of volition.
The force and the volition are both limited, but within the
limitations they constitute the power of man. Pass, then,
to the works of Nature, or to what you call the power of
Nature. As, in the case of man, you can not conclude that
he created for himself his own faculties, that he prescribed
for himself the limitations of his power over matter, or that
he formed those limitations as mere matters of habit, or
that it was from habit alone that he derived his great constructive
powers, so, in studying the works of Nature, you
must conclude that some intelligent being made the laws
of matter and motion, prescribed the unvarying order and
method of action, laid down the limitations, originated
the properties, and, in so doing, acted by volition, choice,
and design. The distinction, as I conceive, between man
and Nature is, that there has been bestowed on man, in
a very inferior degree, a part of the original power of
creation. On Nature there has been bestowed none of
this power. As we find that the existence of man as an
intelligent being, endowed with certain high faculties,
among which is a certain degree of the power of creating
new objects, can not be accounted for without the
hypothesis of a creator, still less can we account for
the existence and phenomena of Nature, which has in
itself no degree of the creating power, without the same
hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Stop where you are. Why do you separate
man from Nature? Have you yet to learn that man is a
part of Nature? I suspect you have, after all, been reading
the book of Genesis for something more than a hypothesis,
and that you have adopted the notion that God made
Adam a living soul. Put away all the nursery-stories, and
come down to the "hard-pan" of actual facts, which show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
by an overwhelming array of evidence that man had a very
different origin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> You know, my friend, that I never learned
any nursery-stories, and therefore I have none to unlearn.
It may be my misfortune, but I find myself here in the
world in mature years, studying the phenomena of life,
without having had any early teaching, but with such
reasoning as I can apply to what I observe, and to what
science, history, and philosophy can furnish to me. I belong
to no church, to no sect, to no party, and I have not
even a country. I am a citizen of the world, on my travels
through it, learning what I can. Now, what are your facts?
Let us get down, as you say, upon the "hard-pan," and
make it as hard as you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> First answer my question: Why do you
separate man from Nature?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I know very well that in a certain sense
man is a part of Nature. But it is necessary to contemplate
man apart from all the rest of Nature, because we find that
he is endowed with intellect, and we have very good and
direct evidence that his intellect is an actor; and we know
that he is endowed with consciousness, and we have very
good and direct evidence that, by introspection, he becomes
aware of his own consciousness, and what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Very well, assume all that if you choose.
Now let me show you an origin of man, with his intellect
and consciousness, which will entirely overthrow the idea
that he was a special creation in the sense to which you
seem to be drifting, namely, that of miraculous interposition
by a being called God. You must be aware, as you
have read so much, that modern science has made great
discoveries, and that there are certain conclusions on this
subject which are drawn from very numerous and important
data. Those data involve the origin of all the different
animals, man included. They are all to be accounted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
in the same way and by the same reasoning. Now, if we
go back to a period when none of them existed, we find a
method of accounting for them that is infinitely superior
as a hypothesis to any idea of their special creation as an
act or as a series of acts of divine and direct interposition.
I will take this method as it is given by Herbert Spencer,
because, as he has reasoned it, it accounts for both intellect
and consciousness; and Mr. Spencer is allowed to be one
of the leading minds of this age. Mark the starting-point
of his whole philosophy on this subject of organic life.
Darwin, as you know, supposes some one very low form of
organic life, an aquatic grub, and out of it he evolves all
the other animal organisms, by the process of natural and
sexual selection, through successive generations, ending in
man. This hypothesis leaves the original organism to be
accounted for, and, although Darwin does not expressly assert
that it was the Creator who fashioned the first organism,
he leaves it to be implied. Spencer, on the other hand,
explicitly denies the absolute commencement of organic life
on the globe. Observe that the terms of his theory of evolution
are much more complete than Darwin's, for he says
that "the affirmation of universal evolution is in itself a
negation of an absolute commencement of anything. Construed
in terms of evolution, every kind of being is conceived
as a product of modifications wrought by insensible
gradations on a pre-existing being; and this holds as fully
of the supposed commencement of organic life, or a first
organism, as of all subsequent developments of organic
life."<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>You will see, therefore, that the idea of a Creator, fashioning
a type of animal organism, or making a commencement
of organic life, is excluded by this great philosopher,
although he does concur in the main in Darwin's general ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>planation
of the mode in which one organism is evolved out
of a pre-existing organism. He goes much farther, because
his system of universal evolution embraces the elements out
of which any organic life whatever has been developed, and
negatives the idea of any absolute commencement of anything
whatever. He begins with the original molecules of
organizable matter. By modifications induced upon modifications
these become formed, by their inherent tendencies,
into higher types of organic molecules, as we see in the
artificial evolution effected by chemists in their laboratories;
who, although they are unable to form the complex
combinations directly from their elements, can form them
indirectly through successive modifications of simpler combinations,
by the use of equivalents. In Nature, the more
complex combinations are formed by modifications directly
from the elements, and each modification is a change of
the molecule into equilibrium with its environment, subjecting
it, that is to say, to new conditions. Then, larger
aggregates, compound molecules, are successively generated;
more complex or heterogeneous aggregates arise out of one
another, and there results a geometrically increasing multitude
of these larger and more complex aggregates. So that
by the action of the successive higher forms on one another,
joined with the action of the environing conditions, the
highest forms of organic molecules are reached. Thus in
the early world, as in the modern laboratory, inferior types
of organic substances, by their mutual actions under fit
conditions, evolved the superior types of organic substances,
and at length ended in organizable protoplasm. Now, let
me read to you Mr. Spencer's description of the mode in
which the substance called "protein" becomes developed
into organic life. "And it can hardly be doubted," he
says, "that the shaping of organizable protoplasm, which
is a substance modifiable in multitudinous ways with extreme
facility, went on after the same manner. As I learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
from one of our first chemists, Prof. Frankland, protein
is capable of existing under probably at least a thousand
isomeric forms; and, as we shall presently see, it is capable
of forming, with itself and other elements, substances yet
more intricate in composition, that are practically intricate
in their varieties of kind. Exposed to those innumerable
modifications of conditions which the earth's surface afforded,
here in amount of light, there in amount of heat,
and elsewhere in the mineral quality of its aqueous medium,
this extremely changeable substance must have undergone,
now one, now another, of its countless metamorphoses.
And to the mutual influences of its metamorphic forms,
under favoring conditions, we may ascribe the production
of the still more composite, still more sensitive, still more
variously-changeable portions of organic matter, which, in
masses more minute and simpler than existing <em>protozoa</em>,
displayed actions varying little by little into those called
vital actions, which protein itself exhibits in a certain degree,
and which the lowest known living things exhibit
only in a greater degree. Thus, setting out with inductions
from the experiences of organic chemists at the one
extreme, and with inductions from the observations of
biologists at the other extreme, we are enabled to deductively
bridge the interval&mdash;are enabled to conceive how
organic compounds were evolved, and how, by a continuance
of the process, the nascent life displayed in these becomes
gradually more pronounced."<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>It is in this way that Spencer accounts for the formation
of the cell which becomes developed into a living
organism, out of which are successively evolved all the
higher forms of animal organisms, until we reach man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> And is this put forward as something
which rational people are to believe?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Undoubtedly it is put forward as something
that is to be believed, because it is supported by a vast array
of evidence; and let me tell you that this conception
of Nature as a whole is the consummate flower of this
nineteenth century in the domain of philosophic speculation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Perhaps it is. But although this nineteenth
century has witnessed many great scientific discoveries,
and has produced extraordinary inventions, I do not
find that among the speculative philosophers of this age
there are such very superior powers of reasoning displayed
that we ought to regard them as authorities entitled to
challenge our acceptance of their theories without examination.
I must say that among your scientific people of
the present day, and especially among the philosophers of
the class of which Mr. Spencer is the leading representative,
there are certain tendencies and defects which surprise
me. One of their defects is that they do not obviate remote
difficulties, perhaps because they have not been trained,
as other men have, to foresee where such difficulties must
arise. This is sometimes apparent even when the difficulties
are not very remote, but are quite obvious. One of
their tendencies is to arrive at a theory from some of the
phenomena, and then to strain the remaining phenomena
to suit the theory; and sometimes they proceed to the invention
or imagination of phenomena which are necessary
to the completion of a chain of proof. This last process is
called bridging the interval. I will now apply this criticism
to Mr. Spencer's philosophy of the origin of man. In
the first place he has not obviated a fundamental difficulty,
whether it be a near or a remote one. Where did the
molecules get their tendency or capacity to arrange themselves
into higher and more complex forms? Whence
came the auxiliary or additional force of their surrounding
environment? What endowed <em>protein</em> with its capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
to assume a thousand isomeric forms? What made the
favoring conditions which have helped on the influence
of its metamorphic tendencies, so as to produce still more
sensitive and variously-changeable portions of organic matter?
These questions must have an answer; and, when
we ask them, we see the significance of the inquiry, "Where
wast thou (man) when I laid the foundations of the world?"
For these things, on the evolution theory, <em>are</em> the foundations
of the world. It is no answer to say, as Mr. Spencer
does, that these tendencies, or capacities of matter, and
these laws of the favoring conditions, came from the Unknown
Cause. Known or unknown, did they have a cause,
or did they make themselves? Did these, the foundations
of the world, have an origin, or were they without any
origin? If they had an origin, was it from the will and
power of a being capable of giving existence to them and
prescribing their modes of action? If they had no origin,
if they existed from all eternity, how came it that they
formed this extraordinary habit of invariable action in a
certain method, which amid all its multiformity shows an
astonishing persistency? If we deny, with Mr. Spencer,
the absolute commencement of organic life on the globe,
we must still go back of all the traces of organic life, and
inquire whence matter, molecules, organized or unorganized,
derived the capacities or tendencies to become organized,
and how the favoring conditions became established
as auxiliary or subsidiary forces. And therefore it is that
this difficulty, whether remote or near at hand, is not met
by Mr. Spencer: for whether we call the cause an unknown
or a known cause, the question is, Was there a cause, or did
the foundations of the world lay themselves? The reasoning
powers of mankind, exercised by daily observation of
cause and effect, of creative power and created product, are
equal to the conception of a First Cause as a being who
could have laid the foundations of the world, but they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
utterly unequal to the conception that they had no origin
whatever. Again, consider how numerous are the missing
links in the chain of evolution, how many gaps are filled
up by pure inventions or assumptions. The evolution of
one distinct and perfect animal, or being, out of a pre-existing
animal or being of a different type, has never been
proved as a fact. Yet whole pedigrees of such generation
of species have been constructed upon the same principles
as we should construct the pedigree of an individual. Furthermore,
if we regard the facts about which there can be
no controversy, we find not only distinct species of animals,
but we find the same species divided into male and female,
with a system of procreation and gestation established for
the multiplication of individuals of that species. Now go
back to the imaginary period when protein began to form
itself into something verging toward organic life, and then
there became evolved the nascent life of an organized being.
How did the division of the sexes originate? Did
some of the molecules or their progressive forms, or their
aggregates, or masses, under some conditions, tend to the
production of the male, and others under certain conditions
tend to the development of the female, so that the
sexes were formed by a mere habit of arrangement without
any special intervention? Here is one of the most serious
difficulties which the doctrine of evolution, whether it be
the Darwinian or the Spencerian theory, has to encounter.
There is a division into male and female: there is a law of
procreation by the union of the two sexes. This is a fact
about which there can be no dispute. It is one of the most
remarkable facts in Nature. It is the means by which species
are continued, and the world is peopled with individuals
of each species. Is it conceivable that this occurred without
any design, that it had no origin in a formative will,
that it had, properly speaking, no origin at all, but that it
grew out of the tendencies of organized matter to take on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
such a diversity in varying conditions? And if the latter
was all the origin that it had, whence came the tendencies
and whence the favoring conditions that helped them on
toward the result? It seems to me that the Spencerian
theory, so far as it suggests a mode in which the two sexes
of animals came to exist, is hardly less fanciful than what
Plato has given us in his "Timæus." I have studied them
both.</p>

<p>If you will hand me Mr. Spencer's work from which
you have just quoted, I will point out a passage which fully
justifies my criticism. It is this: "Before it can be ascertained
how organized beings have been gradually evolved,
there must be reached the conviction that they have been
gradually evolved." He says this in praise of De Maillet,
one of the earliest of the modern speculators who reached
this conviction, and whose "wild notions" as to the way
should not make us, says Mr. Spencer, "forget the merit
of his intuition that animals and plants were produced by
natural causes."<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> That is to say, first form to yourself a
theory, and have a thorough conviction of it. Then investigate,
and shape the facts so as to support the theory.
Is it not plain that an inquiry into the mode in which organized
beings have been gradually evolved must precede
any conclusion or conviction on the subject? It is one of
those cases in which the <em>how</em> a thing has been done lies at
the basis of the inquiry whether it has probably been done
at all. If a suggested mode turns out to be wild and visionary,
what is the value of any "intuition" of the main
fact? But, what is still more extraordinary in this kind
of deduction, which is no deduction, is the way in which,
according to Mr. Spencer, the first conviction is to be
reached before one looks for the facts. The process of the
evolution of organisms, according to Mr. Spencer's philoso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>phy,
is contained as a part in the great whole of evolution
in general. We first convince ourselves that evolution obtains
in all the other departments of Nature, and is the
interpretation of all their phenomena. Then we conclude
that it has obtained in the animal kingdom, and so we have
the conviction necessary to be acquired before we examine
the phenomena; and then we make that investigation so as
to reconcile the facts with the supposed universal laws of
matter and motion. I do not exaggerate in the least. Here
is what he says: "Only when the process of evolution of
organisms is affiliated on the process of evolution in general
can it be truly said to be explained. The thing required is
to show that its various results are corollaries from first
principles. We have to reconcile the facts with the universal
laws of the redistribution of matter and motion."<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
What would Bacon have thought of this method of establishing
the probable truth of a theory? It leaves out of
consideration a multitude of facts, and one of them at least
is of the utmost importance. It is that in the domain of
animated matter, in organized beings, and most signally in
the animal kingdom, there is a principle of life; and, whatever
may be the universal laws of the redistribution of matter
and motion, in their operation upon or among the products
which are not endowed with this principle, when we
come to reason about products that <em>are</em> endowed with it
we are not entitled to conclude that this principle of animal
life is itself a product of the operation of those laws
because they have resulted in products which do not possess
life, or life of the same kind. In order to reach the conviction
that animal organisms have resulted solely from the
operation of the laws of matter and motion, we must not
undertake to reconcile the facts with those laws, but we
must have some evidence that those laws have produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
living beings with complex and diversified organisms, and
this evidence must at least tend to exclude every other hypothesis.
It is not enough to flout at all other hypotheses,
or to pronounce them <i lang="la">ex cathedra</i> to be idle tales.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You must not catch at single expressions
and make yourself a captious critic. That would be unworthy
of such an inquirer as you profess to be, and as I
believe you are. Mr. Spencer did not mean, by reconciling
the facts with the laws of matter and motion, that we are
to distort the facts. He meant that we are to discover the
correspondence between the facts and the operation of those
laws. Now, let me show you more explicitly that he is
quite right. There are certain laws of matter and motion,
discoverable and discovered by scientific investigation, which
prevail throughout all Nature. The phenomena which they
produce, although not yet fully understood, justify the assumption
of their universality and their modes of operation.
It is perfectly legitimate, therefore, to reason that the same
laws which have produced the observable phenomena in
other departments of Nature have had a like potency as
causes by which the phenomena in the animal kingdom
have been produced. Using this legitimate mode of reasoning,
Mr. Spencer traces the operation of those laws upon
the primal molecules, which are peculiarly sensitive to their
effects. He follows them through the successive aggregations
of higher combinations until he arrives at the protoplasmic
substance, out of which, from its capability of
assuming an infinity of forms, aided by the environing
conditions, the simplest organic forms become evolved,
and thus what you call the principle of life gradually arose
through a vast extent of time. He is therefore perfectly
consistent with himself in denying the absolute commencement
of organic life on the globe; for you must understand
that he means by this to deny that there was any point of
time, or any particular organism, at or in which animal life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
can be said to have had its first commencement, without
having been preceded by some other kind of being, out of
which the more highly organized being has been produced
by modifications wrought by insensible gradations. If you
will attend closely to his reasoning, you will see that you
have small cause for criticising it as you have; and, if you
will look at one of his illustrations, you will see the strength
of his position. Hear what he says: "It is no more needful
to suppose an absolute commencement of organic life
or a 'first organism' than it is needful to suppose an absolute
commencement of social life and a first social organism.
The assumption of such a necessity in this last case,
made by early speculators with their theories of 'social
contracts' and the like, is disproved by the facts; and the
facts, so far as they are ascertained, disprove the assumption
of such a necessity in the first case."<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> That is to
say, as the social facts, the social phenomena, disprove the
"social contract" as an occurrence taking place by human
design and intention, so the phenomena of animal life disprove
the assumption of such an occurrence as its commencement
by divine intervention, or its commencement
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I think I understood all this before, just
as you put it, but I am not the less obliged to you for the
restatement. In regard to society, I know not why the
family, the institution of marriage, is not to be regarded as
the first social organism, and the union of two or more
families in some kind of mutual league is certainly the first
society in a more comprehensive sense. I care very little
about the theory of the social contract, as applied to more
complex societies, although, as a kind of legal fiction, it is
well enough for all the uses which sound reasoners nowadays
make of it. But the institution of marriage, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
family, is no fiction at all; it is a fact, however it was first
established, and it was the absolute commencement of social
life. But I do not hold to this sort of analogies, or to this
mode of reasoning from what happens in a department, in
which the actions of men have largely or exclusively influenced
the complex phenomena, to a department in which
human influence has had nothing to do with the phenomena.
But now let us come back to the proposition that
there never was any absolute commencement of organic life
on the globe. I will take Mr. Spencer's meaning&mdash;his denial,
as you put it&mdash;and will test it by one or two observations
upon his own explanation, as given in the elaborate
paper in which he replied to a critic in the "North American
Review" a little more than four years ago.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In the
first place, then, as to time. It will not do to say that
there never was a time when such a product as life, animated
or organized life, had its first existence. To whatever
it owed its existence, it must at some time have begun
to exist. It matters not how far back in the ages of the
globe you place it: you must contemplate a time when it
did not exist, and a point of time at which it began to exist.
It matters not that you can not fix this time. There was
such a time, whether you can fix it chronologically or not.
In the next place, however minute the supposed gradations
which you trace backward from a recognizable organism to
the primal protoplasmic substance, out of which you suppose
it to have been gradually evolved, and through whatever
extent of time you imagine these gradations to have
been worked out by the operation of the forces of Nature,
modifying successive beings, you must find an organism to
which you can attribute life. Whatever that organism was,
it was the commencement of organic life; for, when you
go back of it in the series, you come to something that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
not organic life, but was merely a collection of molecules
or a product of aggregated molecules, that had a capacity
to be developed into an animated organism under favorable
conditions. "It is," says Mr. Spencer, "by the action of
the successively higher forms on one another, joined with
the action of environing conditions, that the highest forms
are reached." Some one, then, of those highest forms,
something that can be called an animal organism, some
being endowed with life, was the commencement of organic
life on the globe; and it is just as correct and necessary to
speak of it as the "absolute" commencement as it is when
we speak of Darwin's aquatic grub, or of the Mosaic account
of the creation of the different animals by the hand
and will of God. Neither Mr. Spencer nor any other man
can construct a chain of animated existence back into the
region of its non-existence without showing that it began to
have an existence. He can say that the affirmation of universal
evolution is in itself a negation of an absolute commencement
of anything. And so it is theoretically. But
this does not get over the difficulty. On his own explanation
of the mode in which organisms have been evolved,
there must have been a first organism, and in that first organism
life began. So that I am not yet prepared to yield
my criticism, or to yield my convictions to a writer who is
so much carried away by his theory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> But you will allow that the theory is perfect
in itself; and why, then, do you say that he is carried away
by it? You ought either to give up your criticism, or to
show that there is a superior hypothesis by which to account
for the origin of organisms, and one that is supported
by stronger proofs and better reasoning. You have nothing
to oppose to Mr. Spencer's explanation of the origin of
organic life, excepting the fable which you find in the book
of Genesis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Undoubtedly the opposite hypothesis is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
which attributes to a Creator the production of organic life;
and whether the Mosaic account, as it stands, be a fable or
a true narrative of an actual occurrence, what we have to
do is to ascertain, upon correct principles of reasoning,
whether the creating power can be dispensed with. Mr.
Spencer dispenses with it altogether. He gives it a direct
negative in the most absolute manner. But the perfection
of his theory depends upon its ability to sustain itself as an
explanation of the existence of organisms without the intervention of
a creating power anywhere at any time. I
have already suggested the serious defect of his whole philosophic
scheme as applied to the existence of organisms,
namely, that the foundation of the theory, the existence of
the molecules with their properties and capacities tending
to rearrangement under the laws of matter and motion,
those laws themselves, and the environing conditions which
assist the process of adjustment and combination, must all
have had an origin, or a cause. If we can get along without
that origin, without any cause, without any actor laying
the foundations of the world, we can make a theory.
But that theory can not sustain itself by such a negation if
all experience, observation, and reflection amount to anything;
for these all point in one direction. They all tend
to show that every existing thing must have had a cause,
that every product must have had an origin, and, if we
place that origin in the operation of certain laws of matter
and motion upon and among the primal molecules of matter,
we still have to look for the origin of those laws and
of the molecules on which they have operated. If we say
that these things had no origin, that they existed without
having been caused to exist, we end in a negation at which
reason at once rebels. If, on the other hand, we reject, as
we must reject, this negation, then the same power which
could establish the laws of matter and motion, and give
origin to the molecules and the favoring conditions by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
their aggregated higher forms are supposed to have been
developed, was alike capable of the direct production of
species, the creation of the sexes, and the establishment
of the laws of procreation and gestation. So that it becomes
a question of probability, of the weight of evidence,
as to whether we can explain the phenomena of species, of
the sexual division and the sexual union, with all that they
involve, without the hypothesis of direct intervention, design,
and formative skill of a boundless character. I have
seen no explanation of the origin of species and of the sexual
distinction, with its concomitant methods of reproduction,
that does not end in an utter blank, whenever it
undertakes to dispense with that kind of direct design to
which is derisively given the name of "miraculous interposition,"
but which in truth implies no miracle at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I have to be perpetually recalling you to the
first principles of Mr. Spencer's philosophy. You seem to
think it enough to point to the existence of species and the
sexual division, as if his philosophy did not afford the
means of accounting for them by the operation of natural
causes. Let me put to you, then, this question: If natural
causes have produced a crystal, by successive new combinations
of molecules of matter through gradations rising successively
into higher forms, why should not natural causes,
acting upon other molecules in a corresponding way, have
produced organic life, or animated organisms? If natural
causes have evolved out of certain molecules the substance
known as organizable protein, why should not the continued
operation of the same or similar causes have modified
organizable protein into some distinct and recognizable
animated organism? If you admit this as a possible or
highly probable result, why should not natural causes have
produced, in the course of millions of years, the division
of the sexes and the methods of procreation and multiplication?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I will assign the reasons for not adopting
the conclusions to which you expect me to arrive, in a certain
order. In the first place, the capacity of certain molecules
to result in the formation of a crystal, under the operation
of what you call natural causes, requires that the
molecules, their capacity, and the natural causes should all
have had an origin, call it known or unknown. The cause
was of equal potency to produce the crystal directly, or anything
else that exists in Nature. The same thing is true of
certain other molecules which, under the operation of the so-called
natural causes, have resulted in organizable protein.
There must have been an origin to the molecules, to their
capacity, and to the laws which effect their combinations;
and this cause could equally fashion an organism and
fashion it in the related forms of male and female by direct
intervention, for to such a power there is no assignable
limit. In the next place, the distinction between inanimate
and animated matter, between beings endowed and
beings not endowed with animal life, is a distinction that
can not be overlooked; for, although we find this distinction
to be a fact that has resulted after the operation of
whatever causes may have produced it, we must still note
that there is a distinction, and a very important one. It
may be that the dividing line is very difficult of detection;
that it is impossible to determine in all cases just where
organizable matter passes from dead matter into a living
organism. But that at some point there has arisen a living
organism, however produced, is certain. Now, suppose
that what you call natural causes have operated to bring
organizable matter up to this dividing line, the question is,
whether we can conclude that they have had the potency
to pass that line, and to lead of themselves to all the varying
and manifold results of species, the division of the sexes,
and all that follows that division. Certain great facts
seem to me to negative this conclusion. The first is, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
we have species, which differ absolutely from each other as
organisms, in their modes of life, and their destinies, however
strong may be the resemblances which obtain among
them in certain respects. The second fact is, that each of
the true species is divided into the related forms of male
and female, and is placed under a law of procreation, by
the sexual union, for the multiplication of individuals of
that species. The third fact is, that no crosses take place
in Nature between different species of animals&mdash;between the
true species&mdash;resulting in a third species, or a third animal.
It is true that multiplication of individuals of some of the
lowest organisms takes place without the bisexual process
of procreation, as where, in the severance of a part of an
organism the severed part grows, under favorable conditions,
into a perfect organism of the same kind, as in the analogous
phenomenon of a plant propagated by a branch or a
slip from the parent stem. But this occurrence does not
take place among the animals which are placed for their
multiplication under the law of the sexual union and the
sexual procreation. The sexual division, therefore, the law
of sexual procreation, and all that they involve, have to be
accounted for. Can they be accounted for by the theory
of evolution? Wherever you place their first occurrence,
you have to find a process adequate to their production.
What, then, entitles you to say that the hypothesis of their
production, by the capacity and tendency of organizable
substances, when they have reached certain combinations,
is superior to the hypothesis of a direct interposition and a
formative will? At the outset, you must begin with some
interposition and some formative will; you must account
for the existence of the very capacities of matter to become
organized under the laws of the redistribution of matter
and motion, or you will end nowhere whatever. If you
assume, as you must, that, in laying "the foundations of
the world," there was exercised some interposition and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
formative will, you have a power which was just as adequate
to the production of species, and their sexual division, as
it was to the endowment of matter with certain properties
and capacities, and the establishment of any laws for the
redistribution of matter and motion. If you deny the existence
and potency of the original power in the one production
you must deny them in the other. If you concede
them in the one case, you must concede them in the other.
Now, although the original power was equal to the endowment
of organizable matter with its capacities for and tendencies
to organization, and may be theoretically assumed
to have made that endowment, the question is, whether
these capacities and tendencies, without special formative
interposition, and by the mere force of what you call natural
causes, were equal to the production of such phenomena
as the division of the sexes and all that follows that division.
Can it with any truth he said that the so-called
natural causes have produced any phenomena which can be
compared, on the question of special design, to the phenomena
of the sexual division, the law of sexual procreation,
and the whole system of the multiplication of individuals
of distinct and true species? When I can see any
facts which will warrant the belief that the origin of the
sexes is to be attributed to the capacity of organizable protein
to form itself into new compounds, to the capacity of
these new compounds to become living organisms, and to
the capacity of these living organisms, without the intervention
of any formative will specially designing the result,
to divide themselves into related forms of male and female,
to establish for themselves the law of procreation, and to
limit that procreation to the same species, I shall, perhaps,
begin to see some ground for the superior claims of the
evolution hypothesis. I should like, by-the-by, to see a
system of classification of animal organisms, based exclusively
on the distinction between the bisexual and the uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>sexual,
or the non-sexual, methods of reproduction, and
without running it out into the analogies of the vegetable
world. I fancy that it would be found extremely difficult
to account for the bisexual division without reaching the
conclusion that it required and was effected by a special
interposition. At all events, I should like to see it explained
how the asexual and the unisexual construction passed
into the bisexual by the mere operation of what you call
natural causes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You said, a while ago, that you had never
learned any nursery-stories. Yet, all along, you seem to me
to have been under the influence of the Mosaic account of
the creation. Of course you have read it, and, although you
did not learn anything about it in childhood, and now try
to treat it solely as a hypothesis, without any regard to its
claims as a divinely inspired narrative, it is certainly worth
your while to see how completely it becomes an idle tale of
the nursery when scientific tests are applied to it. Hear
what Spencer says about the creation of man, as given by
Moses: "The old Hebrew idea that God takes clay and
molds a new creature, as a potter might mold a vessel, is
probably too grossly anthropomorphic to be accepted by
any modern defender of special creations."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Let us see about this. Let us discard all
idea of the source from which Moses received his information
of the occurrences which he relates, and put his account
upon the same level with Plato's description of the
origin of animals, and with the Darwinian or Spencerian
theory of that origin; regarding all three of them, that is
to say, as mere hypotheses. Whatever may be the supposed
conflict between the Mosaic account of the creation and the
conclusions of geologists concerning the periods during
which the earth may have become formed as we now find
it, the question is, on the one hand, whether the Hebrew
historian's account of the process of creation is a concep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>tion
substantially the same as that at which we should have
arrived from a study of Nature if we had never had that
account transmitted to us from a period when the traditions
of mankind were taking the shapes in which they have
reached us from different sources; or whether, on the other
hand, it is so "grossly anthropomorphic" and absurd that
it is not worthy of any consideration as an occurrence that
it will bear the slightest test of scientific scrutiny. Let any
one take the Mosaic narrative, and, divesting himself of all
influence of supposed inspiration or divine authority speaking
through the chosen servant of God, and disregarding
the meaning of those obscure statements which divide the
stages of the work into the first and the second "day," etc.,
let him follow out the order in which the Creator is said by
Moses to have acted. He will find in the narrative an
immense condensation, highly figurative expressions, and
many elliptical passages. But he will also find that the
Creator is described as proceeding in the exertion of his
omnipotent power in a manner which we should be very
likely to deduce from a study of his works without this
narrative. We have, first, the reduction of the earth from
its chaotic condition&mdash;"without form and void"&mdash;to the
separation of its elemental substances; then the creation of
light; the separation of earth and water; the productive
capacity of the dry land; the establishment of the vegetable
kingdom, each product "after its kind"; the formation
of the heavenly bodies as lights in the firmament, to
make the division of day and night, seasons and years. It
is obviously immaterial, so far as this order of the work is
concerned, down to the stage when the formation of the
first animals took place, in what length of time this first
stage of the work was accomplished; whether it was done
by an Omnipotence that could speak things into existence
by a word, or whether the process was carried on through
periods of time of which we can have no measure, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the operation of infinitely slow-moving agencies selected
and employed for the accomplishment of a certain result.
Confining our attention to the first stage of the work as we
find it described, we have the formation of the earth, light,
air, the heavenly bodies, alternations of day and night,
seasons and years, and the vegetable kingdom, before any
animal creation. We then come to the formation of animals
which are to inhabit this convenient abode, and which
are described as taking place in the following order: first
the water animals, the fowls of the air, and the beasts of
the field, "each after its kind"; then, and finally, the
creation of man. Respecting his creation, we are told that
it was the purpose of the Almighty to make a being after a
very different "image" from that of any other creature on
the earth; and whatever may be the true interpretation of
the language employed, whether man was created literally
"in our image, after our likeness," or according to an image
and a likeness of which his Creator had conceived, there
can be no doubt that what Moses described as the purpose
of God was to make a being differing absolutely from all
the other animals by a broad line of demarkation which is
perfectly discoverable through all the resemblances that
obtain between him and all the other living creatures. To
this new being there was given, we are told, dominion over all
the other animals, and the fruits of the earth were assigned
to him for food; he was formed out of the dust of the earth,
the breath of life was breathed into his nostrils, and he became
"a living soul." Let us now see if this statement of
the creation of man is so "grossly anthropomorphic" as is
supposed. You are aware that Buffon, who was certainly
no mean naturalist or philosopher, and who was uninfluenced
by the idea that the book of Genesis was an inspired
production, reached the conclusion that a study of nature
renders the order of man's creation as described by Moses a
substantially true hypothesis. "We are persuaded," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Buffon, "independently of the authority of the sacred
books, that man was created last, and that he only came to
wield the scepter of the earth when that earth was found
worthy of his sway."<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> You evolutionists will say that this
may be very true upon your hypothesis of his gradual development
out of other animals, through untold periods of
time. But now let us see whether Moses was so grossly
unscientific, upon the supposition that God created man as
he describes. If man was created, or molded, by the
Deity, he was formed, in his physical structure, out of matter;
and all matter may be figuratively and even scientifically
described as "the dust of the earth," or as "clay,"
or by any other term that will give an idea of a substance
that was not spirit. If Moses had said that man's body
was formed out of the constituent elements of matter, or
some of them, he would have said nothing that a modern
believer in special creations need shrink from, for he would
have stated an indisputable fact. He stated in one form
of expression the very same fact that a modern scientist
would have to state in another form, whatever might have
been the mode, or the power, or the time in or by which
the constituent elements were brought together and molded
into the human body. So that the derisive figure of God
taking clay and molding it into the human form, as a potter
would mold a vessel, does not strike me as presenting any
proof that the account given by Moses is so destitute of
scientific accuracy, or as rendering his statements a ridiculous
hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Well, then, it comes at last to this: that you
consider the substance of the Mosaic account of the creation,
independent of its authority as an inspired statement, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
entitled to stand as a hypothesis against the explanations
given to us by the scientists of the great modern school of
evolution, notwithstanding those explanations are in one
form or another now accepted by the most advanced scientific
thinkers and explorers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I certainly do. But understand me explicitly.
As, after my study of the probable origin of the
solar system, and our discussion of that subject, I expressed
my conclusion that the phenomena called for and manifested
the exercise of a formative will by some acts of special
creation, so now, in reference to the animal kingdom,
I have reached the same conclusion, for reasons which I
have endeavored to assign. I can see that the operation of
the process which you call evolution may have caused certain
limited modifications in the structure and habits of
life of different animals; or rather, that limited modifications
of structure and habits of life have occurred, and
hence you deduce what you call the process of evolution.
But to me this entirely fails to account for, or to suggest
a rational explanation of, the distinct existence of species,
their division into male and female, and the establishment
of the laws of procreation by which individuals of a species
are multiplied&mdash;a process which does not admit of the
production of individuals of an essentially different type
from the parents, and which, so far as we have any means
of knowledge, has never commenced in one species and
ended in another, in any length of time that can be imagined,
or through any series of modifications.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Let us postpone the farther discussion of the
origin of species to some future time, when I will endeavor
to convince you that both Darwin and Spencer have satisfactorily
accounted for them.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>THE SINGLE-CELL HYPOTHESIS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It will readily occur to the reader that Sophereus might most
pertinently have asked: Whence did the primal cell originate? It is conceived
of as the ultimate unit of organizable matter; invisible to the naked
eye, perhaps incapable of being reached by the microscope, but consisting
of an infinitesimally small portion of matter, more or less organized in
itself, and possessing a capacity to unite with itself other minute particles
of matter, and so to form larger aggregates of molecules. The hypothesis
is, that this single cell has given origin to all animated organisms, and,
through an indefinite series of such organisms, to the human race. The
single cell, then, having this capacity and this extraordinary destiny, was
either the first and only one of its kind, or it was one of many of the same
kind. If we select any supposed point of time in the far antecedent history
of matter, the question may be asked whether there existed at first but one
such cell, or many. If there were many of such cells, how came they to
exist? If one only was selected out of many, for this extraordinary destiny
of giving origin to all the animated organisms, who or what made the
selection for this transcendent office of the one cell? If there never was
but one such cell, how did it come to exist? As these questions are clearly
pertinent, the effort to answer them inevitably conducts us to the idea of
creation, or else to the conclusion that the numerous cells and the selected
one had no origin; that the selection was not made, but was accidental; or
that the one cell, if there never was but one, was not a created thing.
Human reason can not accept this conclusion.</p></blockquote>

</div>


<p class="intro">"Species," "races," and "varieties"&mdash;Sexual division&mdash;Causation.</p>

<p>The two friendly disputants have again met. Sophereus
begins their further colloquy, in an effort to reach a common
understanding of certain terms, so that they may not
be speaking of different things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I have more than once referred to the fact
that Nature does not permit crosses between the true species
of animals, in breeding, and that we have no reason to
suppose it ever did. This is a very important fact to be
considered in weighing the claims of your theory of evolution.
I have been looking into Darwin, and I find it somewhat
uncertain in what sense he uses the terms "species,"
"races," and "varieties." In his "Descent of Man," he
devotes a good deal of space to the discussion of the various
classifications made by different naturalists under these respective
terms; and there is no small danger of confusion
arising from the use of these terms unless they are defined.
The possibility of the process of evolution, as a means of
accounting for the existence of any known animal, depends
in some degree upon the animals among which, by sexual
generation, the supposed transition from one kind of animal
to another kind has taken place. Darwin speaks of
the difficulty of defining "species"; and yet it is obvious
(is it not?) that the theory of the graduation of different
forms into one another depends for its possibility upon
the forms which have admitted of interbreeding. While,
therefore, the term "species" is in one sense arbitrary, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
used by different naturalists, and there is no definition of
it common to them all, it is still necessary to have a clear
idea of the limits within which crosses can take place in
breeding, because there are such limits in nature. Thus,
in the case of man, as known to us in history and by observation,
there are different families, which are classed as
"races." Darwin speaks of the weighty arguments which
naturalists have, or may have, for "raising the <em>races</em> of
man to the dignity of <em>species</em>." Whether this would be
anything more than a matter of scientific nomenclature, is
perhaps unnecessary to consider. Whether we call the
"races" of men "species," or speak of them as families of
one race, we know as a fact that interbreeding can take
place among them all, and that between man and any other
animal it can not take place. The same thing is true of
the equine and the bovine races and their several varieties.
Whether, in speaking of the different families or races of
men, we consider them all as one "species," or as different
species&mdash;and so of the varieties of the equine or the bovine
races&mdash;the important fact is, that there are limits within
which interbreeding can take place, and out of which it can
not take place. Do you admit or deny that the barriers
against sexual generation between animals of essentially different
types, which are established in nature, are important
facts in judging of the hypothesis of animal evolution?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Take care that you have an accurate idea of
what the theory of evolution is. Apply it, for example, to
the origin of man, as an animal, proceeding "by a series
of forms graduating insensibly from some ape-like creature
to man as he now exists." This expresses the whole theory
as applied to one animal, man, without going behind his ape-like
progenitors. It does not suppose a crossing between
the ape-like creature and some other creature that was not
an ape. It supposes a gradual development of the ape-like
creature into the man as he now exists; and, of course, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
interbreeding took place between the males and the females
of that ape-like race and their descendants&mdash;the descendants,
through a long series of forms, being gradually modified
into men, by the operation of the laws of natural and
sexual selection, which I need not again explain to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Very well, I have always so understood the
theory. But then I have also understood it to be a part of
the same theory that there is important auxiliary proof of
the supposed process of evolution to be derived from what
is known to take place in the interbreeding of different
races or families of the same animal. Whatever value there
may be in this last fact, as auxiliary evidence of the supposed
process of evolution, there must have been a time, in
the development of the long series of forms proceeding from
the ape-like progenitor, when an animal had been produced
which could propagate nothing but its own type, and between
which and the surrounding other animals no propagation
could take place, if we are to judge by what all
nature teaches us. You may say that the laws of natural
and sexual selection would still go on operating among the
numerous individuals of this animal which had become in
itself a completed product, and that to their descendants
would be transmitted newly acquired organs and powers,
new habits of life, and all else that natural and sexual selection
can be imagined to have brought about. But at some
time, somewhere in the series, you reach an animal of a
distinct character, in which natural and sexual selection
have done all that they can do; in which there can be no
propagation of offspring but those of a distinct and peculiar
type, and the invincible barrier against a sexual union
with any other type becomes established. For this reason,
we must recognize the limits of possible interbreeding. It
is best for us, therefore, to come to some understanding of
the sense in which we shall use the term "species." For
I shall press upon you this consideration&mdash;that animals dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>fer
absolutely from each other; that there can be no interbreeding
between animals which so differ; and yet that,
without interbreeding between animals having distinct organizations,
natural and sexual selection had not the force
necessary to produce, in any length of time, such a being
as man out of such a being as the ape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I will let Darwin answer you, in a passage
which I will read. "Whether primeval man," he observes,
"when he possessed but few arts, and those of the rudest
kind, and when his power of language was extremely imperfect,
would have deserved to be called man, must depend
on the definition which we employ. In a long series of
forms graduating insensibly from some ape-like creature to
man as he now exists, it would be impossible to fix on any
definite time when the term 'man' ought to be used. But
this is a matter of very little importance." That is to say,
in the long series of forms descending from the ape-like
creature, we can not fix on any one of the modified descendants
which we can pronounce to be separated from
the family of apes, and to have become the new family,
man, because to do this requires a definition of man. Man
as he now exists we know, but the primeval man we do
not know. He may have been an animal capable of sexual
union with some of his kindred who stood nearest to him,
but yet remained apes, or he may not. It is not important
what he was, or whether we can find the time when he
ceased to belong to the family of apes and became the primeval
man. The hypothesis of his descent remains good,
notwithstanding we can not find that time, because it is
supported by a great multitude of facts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I have never seen any facts which I can
regard as giving direct support to the theory. But, waiving
this want of evidence, doubtless it is not important to
find the time, chronologically, when the modified descendants,
supposed to have proceeded from the ape-like creature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
became the primeval man; but it is of the utmost importance
to have some satisfactory grounds for believing that
there ever was such an occurrence as the development of
the animal man, primeval or modern man, out of such an
animal as the ape. And therefore, without reference to
the sense in which naturalists use the term "species," I
shall give you the sense in which I use it. I use it to designate
the animals which are distinct from each other, as
the man, the horse, the ape, and the dog are all distinct
from each other. Speaking of man as one true species, I
include all the races of men. Speaking of the apes as another
species, I include all the families of apes. Speaking
of the bovine, the equine, or the canine species, I include
in each their respective varieties. Now, as crosses in interbreeding
can take place between the different varieties or
families of these several species, and can not take place
between the species themselves&mdash;between those which I
thus class as species&mdash;the limits of such crosses become important
facts in considering the theory of evolution, because
they narrow the inquiry to the possibility of effecting a
propagation of one species out of another species. Take
any animal which has become a completed and final product&mdash;a
peculiar and distinct creature&mdash;whether made so by
aboriginal creation or produced by what you call evolution.
The reproductive faculty of the males and the females of
this distinct and peculiar animal is limited to the generative
reproduction of individuals of the same type, by a
sexual union of two individuals of that type. Their progeny,
in successive generations, may be marked by adventitious
and slowly acquired peculiarities; but unless there
can be found some instance or instances in which the process
of modification has resulted in an animal which we
must regard as an 'essentially new creature&mdash;a new species&mdash;what
becomes of the auxiliary evidence which is supposed
to be derived from the effects of interbreeding between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
those individuals which can interbreed? I lose all hold
upon the theory of evolution, unless I can have some proof
that natural and sexual selection have overcome the barriers
against a sexual union among animals which are divided
into males and females of the several species, each of
which is placed under a law of procreation and gestation
peculiar to itself, and never produces any type but its own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You wander from the principle of evolution.
I have to be perpetually restating it. Observe, then, that
there are multitudes of facts which warrant the belief that,
starting with any one kind of animal organism, however
peculiar and distinct, the struggle for existence among the
enormous number of individuals of that animal becomes
most intense, and a furious battle is constantly going on.
The best-appointed males, in the fierceness of the strife for
possession of the females, develop new organs and powers,
or their original organs and powers are greatly enhanced.
Their descendants share in these modifications; and the
modifications go on in a geometrical ratio of increase
through millions of years, until at some time there is developed
an animal which differs absolutely from its remote
progenitors which were away back in the remote past, and
which began the struggle for individual life and the continuation
of their species or their race in a condition of
things which left the fittest survivors the sole or nearly the
sole propagators of new individuals. This struggle for existence
may have begun&mdash;probably it did begin&mdash;before the
separation of the sexes, when the organism was unisexual
or even asexual. That is to say, there may have been,
and there probably was, an organism which multiplied with
enormous rapidity, without the bisexual method of reproduction.
The vast multitude of such individuals would
lead to the destruction of the weakest; the strong survivors
would continue to give rise to other individuals, modified
from the original type, until at length, by force of this per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>petual
exertion and struggle and the survival of the fittest,
modifications of the method of reproduction would ensue,
and the bisexual division would be developed and perpetuated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I confess I did not expect to hear you go
quite so far. I will yield all the potency to natural and
sexual selection that can be fairly claimed for them as
modifying agencies operating after the sexual division has
come about; but I have, I repeat, seen no facts which justify
the hypothesis that they have led to distinct organisms
between which no propagation can take place. But now
you expect me to accept the startling conclusion that at
some time the asexual or the unisexual method of reproduction
passed into the bisexual, without any formative
will or design of a creating power, and without any act of
direct creation. We know what Plato imagined as the
origin of the sexual division, and that he could not get
along without the intervention of the gods. What modern
naturalist has done any better? I have examined Darwin's
works pretty diligently, and I can not get from them any
solution of the origin of the bisexual division. I am left
to reason upon it as I best can. We know, then, that in
the higher animal organisms the individuals of each species
are divided into the related forms of male and female, and
that for each species there exists the one invariable method
of the sexual union, and a law of gestation peculiar to
itself. One hypothesis is that this system was produced by
the operation of natural causes, like those which are supposed
to have differentiated the various kinds of organisms;
the other hypothesis is that it was introduced with special
design, by an act of some creative will. If we view the
phenomena of the sexual division and the sexual genesis in
the highest animal in which they obtain, we find that they
lead to certain social results, which plainly indicate that in
this animal they exist for a great and comprehensive moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
purpose, which far transcends all that can be imagined as
the moral purpose for which they exist in the other animals.
To a comparatively very limited extent, certain social
consequences flow from the law of sexual division and
genesis among the other animals. But there is no animal
in which the moral and social effects of this law are to be
compared to those which it produces in the human race.
Not only does the same law of multiplication obtain among
the human race; not only does it lead to love of the offspring
far more durable and powerful than in the case of
any other animal; not only is it the origin of a society far
more complex, more lasting, and more varied in its conditions
than any that can be discovered in the associations of
other animals which appear to have some social habits and
to form themselves into communities, but in the human
race alone, so far as we have any means of knowledge, has
the passion of sexual love become refined into a sentiment.
You may remember the passage in the "Paradise Lost" in
which Raphael, in his conversation with Adam, touches so
finely the distinction between sexual love in the human
race and in all the other animals. The angel reminds
Adam that he shares with the brutes the physical enjoyment
which leads to propagation; and then tells him that
there was implanted in his nature a higher and different
capacity of enjoyment in love. The conclusion is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">"... for this cause</div>
<div class="verse">Among the beasts no mate for thee was found."</div>
</div></div>

<p>In the human being alone, even when there is not much
else to distinguish the savage from the beasts around him,
the passion of love is often something more nearly akin to
what might be looked for in an elevated nature, than it can
be among the brutes. What do the poetry and romance
of the ruder nations show, but that this passion of sexual
love in the human being is one in which physical appetite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
and sentimental feeling are so "well commingled" that
their union marks the compound nature of an animal and
a spiritual being? How human society has resulted from
this passion, how in the great aggregate of its forces it
moves the world, how in its highest development it gives
rise to the social virtues, and in its baser manifestations
leads to vice, misery, and degradation, I do not need to
remind you. How, then, is it possible to avoid the conclusion
that in man the sexual passion was implanted by
special design and for a special purpose, which extends far
beyond the immediate end of a continuation of the race?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Why do you resort to a special purpose in
the constitution of one animal, and to the absence of a
similar purpose from the constitution of another animal?
In both, the consequences make a case of the <i lang="la">post hoc</i> just
as plainly as they make a case of the <i lang="la">propter hoc</i>. It is just
as rational to conclude that they only show the former as
it is to conclude that they establish the latter. In man,
we have the physical fact of the sexual division, and all
you can say is that it is followed by certain great and varied
moral phenomena. In the other animals, we have the
same physical fact, followed by moral phenomena less complex
and varied, and not so lasting. In neither case can
you say that there was a special and separate design, according
to which the same physical fact was intended to
produce the special consequences which we observe in each.
Why, as the species called man became developed into beings
of a higher order than the primates of the race or than
their remote progenitors, should not this passion of sexual
love have become elevated into a sentiment and been followed
by the effects of that elevation, just as the gratification
of another appetite, that for food, <i lang="fr">par exemple</i>, has
been refined by the intellectual pleasures of the social banquet
and the interchange of social courtesies? Is there
anything to be proved by the institution or the practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
marriage, beyond this&mdash;that it has been found by experience
to be of great social utility, and is therefore regulated
by human laws and customs, which vary in the different
races of mankind? Monogamy is the rule among some
nations, polygamy is at least allowed in others. You can
predicate nothing of either excepting that each society
deems its own practice to be upon the whole the most advantageous.
You can not say that there is any fixed law
of nature which renders it unnatural for one man to have
more than one wife. In many ages of the world there
have been states of society in which the family has had as
good a foundation in polygamous as it has had in monogamous
unions. Looking, then, at these undeniable facts,
and also at the fact that marriage, whether monogamous
or polygamous, is an institution regulated by human law
and custom, we have to inquire for the reason why human
law and custom take any cognizance of the relation. We
find that, among some of the other animals, the sexes do
not pair excepting for a single birth. The connection lasts
no longer than for a certain period during which the protection
of both parents is needed by the offspring, and not
always so long even as that. It has become the experience
of mankind that the connection of the parents ought to be
formed for more than one birth; shall be of indefinite
duration; and this because of the physical and social benefits
which flow from such a permanency of the union.
This has given rise to certain moral feelings concerning
the relation of husband and wife. But we have no more
warrant, from anything that we can discover in nature, for
regarding the permanency of marriage among the human
race as a divine institution than we have for regarding its
temporary continuance among the other animals as a divinely
appointed temporary arrangement. In the one case, the
permanency of the union has resulted from experience of
its utility. In the other case, the animal perceives no such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
utility, and therefore does not follow the practice. Upon
the hypothesis that all the animals, man included, had a
common origin, it is very easy to account for the difference
which prevails between man and the other animals in this
matter of marriage, or the pairing of the sexes. As man
became by insensible gradations evolved out of some pre-existing
organism, and as moral sentiments became evolved
out of his superior and more complex relations with his
fellows, from his experience of the practical utility of certain
kinds of conduct and practice, the sentiments became
insensibly interwoven with his feelings about the most important
of his social relations, the union of the sexes in
marriage. This is quite sufficient to account for the difference
between man and the other animals in regard to the
duration of such unions, without resorting to any intentional
or divine or superhuman origin of that difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> For the purpose of the argument, I concede
that this is a case of either the <i lang="la">post hoc</i> or the <i lang="la">propter
hoc</i>. I have been pretty careful, however, in all my investigations,
not to lose sight of this distinction in reasoning
on the phenomena of nature or those of society. I think I
can perceive when there is a connection between cause and
effect, when that connection evinces an intelligent design,
and when the phenomena bear no relation to a certain fact
beyond that of sequence in time. What, then, have we to
begin with? We have the fact that the human race is divided
into the two forms of male and female, and that the
passion or appetite of sexual love exists in both sexes, and
that its gratification is the immediate cause of a production
of other individuals of the same species. We next have the
fact that this union of the sexes is followed by an extraordinary
amount of moral and social phenomena that are peculiar
to the human race. This sequence proves to me an
intentional design that the moral and social phenomena
shall flow from the occurrence of the sexual union, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
establishes not only a possibility, but an immensely strong
probability, that the phenomena were designed to flow from
this one occurrence among this particular species of animal.
If this connection between the original physiological fact
and the moral and social phenomena be established to our
reasonable satisfaction, it is the highest kind of moral evidence
of a special design in the existence of the sexual division
and the sexual passion among the human race. You
remember old Sir Thomas Browne's suggestion, that men
might have been propagated as trees are. But they are not
so propagated. If they were, no such consequences would
have followed as those which do follow from the mode in
which they are in fact propagated. These consequences
are most numerous and complex, and they are capable of
being assigned to nothing but the sexual division and the
sexual union as the means of continuing the race. Turn
now to some of the other animals among whom there prevail
the same bisexual division and the same method of procreation
and multiplication. You find they result in sexual
unions of very short duration, and that, if it is followed
by phenomena that in some feeble degree resemble those
which are found in human society, they bear no comparison
in point of complexity and character to those which in the
human race mark the family, the tribe, and the nation.
And here there occurs something which is closely analogous
to what I pointed out to you in considering the supposed
development of the first animal organism. I said that although
you may theoretically suppose that the first animal
organism was formed by the spontaneous union of molecular
aggregates, and that the higher organisms were evolved
out of the lower solely by the operation of causes which
you call "natural," yet that when you come to account for
the existence of true and distinct species, each with its sexual
division and its law of procreation and gestation, you
must infer a special design and a formative will, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
there has never been suggested any method by which the
so-called natural causes could have produced this division
of the sexes and this invariable law of the sexual procreation
among individuals of the same species. Here, then,
we arrive at a distinct moral purpose; for, when we compare
the different social phenomena which follow the operation
of the sexual division and procreation in man with the
social phenomena which follow in the case of the other
animals, we find a difference that is not simply one of degree,
but is one of kind. We find the origin of the family,
the tribe, and the nation: the source of the complex phenomena
of human society. We may therefore rationally
conclude that in man the sexual division and the sexual
passion were designed to have effects that they were not
designed to have in the other animals. To suppose that
these vastly superior consequences in the case of man are
the mere results of his perception of their utility will not
account for the fact that when he does not recognize the
utility&mdash;when he departs from the law of his human existence&mdash;human
society can not be formed and continued.
Although it is possible for human society to exist with polygamous
marriages, and even to have some strength and
duration, yet human society without the family, with promiscuous
sexual intercourse, with no marriages and no ties
between parents and children, never has existed or can
exist. Compare Plato's curious constitution of the body of
"guardians," in his "Republic," and the strange method
of unions, the offspring of which were not allowed to know
their parents or the parents to know their own children.
This was not imagined as a form of human society, but was
entirely like a breeding-stud. Among the brutes, permanent
marriages, families, do not exist, not because the animals
do not perceive their social utility, but because the
purposes of their lives, their manifest destinies, show that
there was no reason for endowing them with any higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
capacity for the sexual enjoyment than that which leads to
the very limited consequences for which the division of the
sexes was in their cases ordained. But in the case of man
there is a further and higher capacity for the sexual enjoyment,
which becomes the root of his social happiness, and
which distinguishes him from the brute creation quite as
palpably as the superiority of his intellectual faculties. In
all this we must recognize a moral purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Pray tell me why it is not just as rational to
conclude that these moral phenomena, as results of the human
passion of love, have become, in all their complex and
diversified aspects, the consequences of a progressive elevation
of the human animal to a higher plane of existence
than that occupied by the inferior species, or than that
occupied by the primeval man. When man had become
developed into an animal in whom the intellect could become
what it is, he could begin to perceive the social utility
of certain modes of life, and from this idea of their
utility would result certain maxims of conduct which would
be acted on as moral obligations. Thus, commencing with
a consciousness that the race exists with the sexual division
into male and female, there would begin to be formed some
ideas of the superior social utility of a regulated sexual
union of individuals and of permanent marriages. These
ideas would become refined as the progressive elevation of
the race went on, and that which we recognize as the sentimental
element in the passion of love would become developed
out of the perceptions of a superior utility in the
permanent devotion and consecration of two individuals to
each other. If, then, by a moral purpose in the establishment
of the bisexual division you mean that all these social
phenomena of the family, the tribe, and the nation were
designed in the human race to follow from that division, I
see no necessity for resorting to any such moral purpose on
the part of a creator, because they might just as well have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
followed from the progressive elevation and development of
the human animal, supposing him to be descended from
some pre-existing type of animal of another and inferior
organization. The philosophy which you seem to be cultivating
closely resembles that which ascribes everything to
the action of mind as its cause. This, you must be aware,
it is the tendency of modern science to antagonize by a different
view of causation. What have you been reading,
that you adhere so pertinaciously to the idea of a moral
purpose adopted by some being, overlooking those physical
causes which may have produced all the results without
that hypothesis?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I have been reading a good deal, but I
have reflected more. I may not be able to reconcile the
metaphysical speculations of the different schools of philosophy
by explanations that will satisfy others, but I can
satisfy myself on one point. This is, that power, force,
energy, causation, are all attributes of mind, and can exist
in a mind only. Let us pass for a moment from abstract
reasoning to an illustration drawn from familiar objects.
A ton of coal contains a certain amount of what is scientifically
called energy. This energy becomes developed by
combustion, which liberates heat. The heat, when applied
to water, converts the water into a vapor called steam&mdash;a
highly elastic substance. The expansion of the steam
against a mechanical instrument called a piston produces
motion, and an engine is driven. The force thus obtained
represents the energy that was latent in the coal. If we
inquire whence the coal obtained this latent energy, there
is a hypothesis which assigns its origin to the sun, which
laid up a certain quantity of it in the vegetable substances
that became converted into coal in one of the geological
periods of the earth's formation. But in order to find
the ultimate and original cause&mdash;the <i lang="la">causa causans</i> of
the whole process&mdash;we must go behind the steam and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
expansive quality, behind the heat which converts the
water into steam, behind the coal and its combustible quality,
and behind the sun and its indwelling heat, a portion
of which was imparted to and left latent in the vegetable
substances that became coal. We must inquire whence
they all originated. If they did not create themselves&mdash;an
inconceivable and inadmissible hypothesis&mdash;they must have
originated in some creating power, which commanded them
to exist and established their connections. Without a mental
energy and its exertions, matter and all its properties,
substance and all its qualities, the sun's indwelling heat
and its capacity to be stored up in vegetable fiber in a latent
condition, could not have existed, and the forces of nature
of which we avail ourselves would never have emerged from
the non-existent state that we conceive of as "chaos." I
know very well that we are accustomed to associate with inanimate
matter the ideas of power, force, energy, and causation.
But if we rest in the conception of these as acting of
themselves, and without being under the control of an originating
mind or a determining will, we may think that we
have arrived at ultimate causes, but we have not. We have
arrived at subsidiary causes&mdash;the instruments, so to speak,
in the control of an intellect which has ordained and uses
them. Whether we look at the physical causes by which
the early Greek philosophers endeavored to explain the
phenomena of the universe, or at one of Plato's conceptions
of a designing and volitional agency in the formation of the
Kosmos, or to another of his conceptions, the sovereignty
of universal ideas or metaphysical abstractions, we are
everywhere confronted with the necessity for assigning an
origin to the physical causes, or to the universal ideas; and
the result is that the idea of a supreme, designing, and volitional
agency is forced upon us&mdash;it is upon me&mdash;by an irresistible
process of reasoning, an invincible necessity of my
mental constitution. I can not agree with Auguste Comte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
who regards it as the natural progress of the human mind
to explain phenomena at first by reference to some personal
agency, and to pass from this mode of explanation to that
by metaphysical abstractions. Nor can I agree with you
scientists, who not only rest satisfied yourselves with the explanation
of the ultimate cause of phenomena by mere physical
agencies, but who insist that others shall not deduce a
personal and volitional agency from the existence of those
physical agencies. To me it seems indispensable, in the
study of phenomena, to recognize moral purposes for which
they have been made to be what they are: and of course a
moral purpose is not assignable to the physical agencies of
matter, or to metaphysical abstractions. Hence it is that
in reasoning on the phenomena of human society, I am
obliged to recognize a moral purpose in the sexual division,
of far greater scope and far more varied consequences than
can be found in the case of the same division among the
other animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I put to you this question: What do you
mean by a moral purpose? In teleology, or the science of
the final causes of things, you must find out the producing
agencies. Let me give you a theory of causation, which
will show you that your notion of a moral purpose is altogether
out of place. The only true causes are phenomenal
ones, or what is certified by experience. There are uniform
and unconditional antecedents, and uniform and unconditional
sequences. Something goes before, uniformly and invariably;
something uniformly and invariably follows. The
first are causes; the last are effects. We can not go farther
back than the antecedent cause; we can not go farther forward
than the effect. We can not connect the effect with
anything but the antecedent cause. When, therefore, you
speak of a moral purpose, what do you mean? Where do
you get the evidence of the moral purpose? What is the
purpose, and what is the evidence of it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I answer you as I have before&mdash;that the
agencies which you call phenomenal causes could not have
established themselves; could not have originated their own
uniformity; could not have made the invariable connection
between themselves and the effects. If we discard the idea
of a moral and sentient being, a mind originating and ordaining
the physical agencies, we have nothing left but
those agencies; and in this the human mind can not rest.
It is not enough to say that it ought to rest there. It does
not, will not, and can not. Science&mdash;what you call science&mdash;may
rest there, but philosophy can not. It is unphilosophical
to speak of the Unknown Cause, or the Unknown
Power, underlying all manifestations, as something of which
we can not conceive and must not personify. The ultimate
power which underlies all phenomena necessarily implies a
will, an intellectual origin, and a mental energy. That it
is something whose mental operations we can not trace, is
no argument against its personality, and no reason why we
should not conceive of it as a mental energy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You have more than once referred to the
constitution of the human mind as if it had been constructed
with an irresistible necessity to attribute everything to the
action of a being, an intelligence, and a will. You should
rather say that <em>some minds</em> have trained themselves to this
mode of reasoning, because they have first received the idea
of such a being as the final cause, as a matter of dogmatic
teaching, and they have tried to reason it out so as to attain
a conviction that what they have been taught is true. It
is in this way that they have found what they consider as
evidence of a moral purpose. But you have no warrant for
the assumption that the human intellect has been put together
in such a way that it can not avoid reaching the
conclusion that all phenomena are to be imputed to the volition
of a mind as their producing cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> In speaking of the human mind and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
incapacity to rest satisfied with what science can discover
of immediate physical agencies in the production of phenomena,
I have not overlooked the fact that the idea of a
Creator has been dogmatically inculcated as a matter of
belief. But I form my conception of the construction of
the human mind from the operations of my own mind. I
have not trained myself into any mode of reasoning. I
have somehow been so placed in this world that, as I have
frequently told you and as I am perfectly conscious, I am
uninfluenced by any early teaching, and can judge for myself
of the force of evidence. When I say, therefore, that
the human intellect is so constituted that it is obliged to
regard mind as the source of power, I exclude all teaching
but the teaching of experience. There can not be two
courses of reasoning that are alike correct. If you uncover
a portion of the earth's surface, and find there structures,
implements, and various objects which you are convinced
that the forces of nature did not produce, you must conclude
that they were the productions of mind availing itself
of the capabilities of matter to be molded and arranged by
the force of an intelligent will. You do not see that mind,
you do not see the work in progress, but you are irresistibly
led to the conclusion that there was a mind which produced
what you have found. You can not reason on the phenomena
at all, without having the conviction forced upon you
that the ultimate cause was an intelligent being. You can
not explain the phenomena without this conclusion. How,
then, can you explain the more various and extraordinary
phenomena of nature without attributing their production
to mind? You have no more direct evidence that the Pyramids
of Egypt, or an obelisk which has lain buried in
the earth for thousands of years, were made by human
hands, than you have for believing that an animal organism,
or the solar system, was planned and executed by an intelligent
being. In both cases, you have only indirect evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>dence;
but in both cases that evidence addresses itself to
your intellect upon the same principles of belief. In the
case of the pyramid or the obelisk, you refer the construction
to mind, because you see that mind alone could have
been the real cause of its existence. In the case of the
animal organism, or the mechanism of the heavenly bodies,
you are obliged to reason in the same way. Hence I say
that our minds are so constituted that there is but one
method of correct reasoning, whether the phenomena are
those which can be attributed only to human intellect, or
are those which must be attributed to superhuman power
and intelligence. Hence, too, I speak of a moral purpose
as indicated by the phenomena. The pyramid and the obelisk
were built with a moral purpose. The animal organism
and all that follows from it, the structure of the solar
system and all that follows from it, were made to be what
they are with a moral purpose. When you ask me for the
evidence of this purpose, I point to the fact that the phenomenal
causes, as you denominate the mere physical agencies
employed in the production of certain objects, were
incapable of any volitional action, and that without volition
the connection between the physical agencies and their
effects could not have been established. The stone and the
chisel were the immediate physical agencies which produced
the obelisk. But who selected the stone and wielded the
chisel? And who designed the moral uses of the obelisk?
Procreation, by the sexual union, is the immediate physical
cause of the existence of an individual animal. But who
designed its structure, appointed for it a law of its being,
and established the physical agencies which brought the
individual into existence and the moral consequences that
those agencies produce?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> We are no nearer to an agreement than we
have been in our former discussions. And the reason is
that you do not perceive the mission and the method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
science. Science undertakes to discover those causes of
phenomena which can be verified by experience; so that we
can truly say that our knowledge has been advanced, and
that we really do know something of the things which we
talk about. This is the domain of science. Its conclusions
do not extend into the region of that which is unknown
and unknowable. Inasmuch as its conclusions are strictly
positive, because they are demonstrated by experience, they
negative, as matter of knowledge, anything beyond. You
may speculate about what lies beyond, but you have no
reason for saying that you know anything about it; whereas
men who reason as you do, and yet who do not accept
dogmas simply as matters of faith, are constantly trying to
persuade themselves that they know something about that
of which they have no means of knowledge. If you accept
that something as a matter of faith, because you are satisfied
with the evidence which establishes, or is supposed to establish,
a divine revelation, you have a ground for belief
with which science does not undertake to interfere. But
you have no ground for maintaining that, from the phenomena
of nature alone, you can derive any knowledge beyond
that which you can demonstrate as a scientific fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I accept your definition of the aims and
methods of science. But what I find fault with is the assumption
that we are not entitled to say that we know or
believe a thing which can not be demonstrated as a scientific
fact, when we are all the time grounding such knowledge
or belief upon reasoning that convinces us of the truth and
reality of other things which in like manner are not demonstrable
as scientific facts. You may say that this is not
the knowledge which we derive from scientific facts, and
therefore it is not to be dignified by the name of knowledge.
But we are always acting and must act upon proofs which
are not scientific demonstrations; and whether we call this
knowledge, or call it belief, we govern our lives according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
to it. We accept the proof that a buried city was the habitation
and work of intelligent human beings, because we
know that the forces of nature, not guided and applied by
intelligent wills, never constructed a city. We accept the
proof that men are just, merciful, courageous, truthful, or
the reverse of all this, because their actions prove it, although
we can not look into their hearts. What does all
the estimate of the characters of men rest upon, but upon
their actions? And is not this entitled to be ranked as
knowledge of the characters of individual men?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> We must each retain his conclusions. Let
our next discussion relate to the origin of the human mind,
and then we shall see whether you will be able to resist the
origin which evolution assigns to it.</p>

<p class="intro">Origin of the human mind&mdash;Mr. Spencer's theory of the composition of
mind&mdash;His system of morality.</p>


<p>According to their appointment, our two disputants
have met to discuss the origin of mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Will you begin this conference by stating
the evolution theory of the origin of the human mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Most willingly. I have thus far spoken of
the hypothesis of evolution as affording an explanation of
the origin of distinct animals, regarded simply as living organisms,
differentiated from each other by the slow process
of development from a common stock, by the operation of
certain physical causes. I am now to account to you for
the origin of the human mind, upon the same hypothesis,
namely, that man is a development from some previous
and lower organism. I acknowledge that what we call
mind, or intellect, has to be accounted for; and that we
who hold the evolution theory of the origin of man as an
animal must be able to suggest how his intellect became
developed by the operation of the same natural causes which
produced his physical organization. It is not material, in
this inquiry, whether we agree with Darwin in assuming
some one distinct living organism of a very low type, as the
original stock from which all the other animal organisms
have been derived, or whether we go with Spencer back to
the primal molecules of organizable matter, and suppose
that from a single cell have been developed all the organisms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
possessing life, in a regular order of succession. Upon
either supposition, the doctrine of evolution explains the
origin of the human mind. For, upon either supposition,
there was a point in the long series of new forms, each descending
from a pre-existing form, at which the manifestations
of what we call mind may be said to have begun.
This link in the connected chain of organisms occurred
where nervous organization began to act with some spontaneous
movement, with some power of voluntary exertion,
as distinguished from the involuntary exertions of a substance
that acted only in a certain and fixed way, although
that substance was endowed with life. The substance of
nervous organization is alike in all animals. In some it
acts in a limited manner, and without volitional control;
in others, it acts in more varied modes, and it manifests
some power of volitional control and volitional rest, as well
as of involuntary movement. But in all animals the substance
of which nervous organization is composed&mdash;the
substance which acts in producing movement, whether voluntary
or involuntary&mdash;is the same kind of physical structure.
In the higher animals, the great nerve-center is the
organ called the brain. To this organ proceed the impressions
produced upon one set of nerves by external objects,
or by light or heat. From the same organ proceed,
by another set of nerves, those movements which the animal
is endowed with the power of making from within.
Contemplating, then, the whole animal kingdom as one
great connected family, but divided into different species,
all of which have a nervous organization, we find that each
species is endowed with the power of generating other individuals
of the same species and of the same nervous organization.
In the long course of development of the several
species, or forms of animal life, there comes about a nervous
organization which acts freely within certain limits, but in
a fixed and invariable mode, so that the movements are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
uniformly the same, and not in any proper sense volitional.
To such an animal we should not attribute any mind, for
mind implies some power of comparison and variation,
some ability to act in more than a prescribed way. This
animal, which I have just supposed to possess a very limited
power of nervous action, transmits that power to its descendants;
and in some of the successive generations the
power remains always at the same fixed point. But the
laws of natural and sexual selection are perpetually operating
among those descendants. In progress of time there
comes to be developed another organism, which has a wider
range of nervous action; and, as this ceaseless process of
modification and improvement goes on, there is developed
still another nervous organization which acts with still more
varied movements. As the different species of animals become
evolved out of those that have gone before, the expansion
of nervous organization goes on; and as each new
and higher and more complex stage is gained, individuals
of the species have the power to transmit it to their descendants
by ordinary generation. At length, as in some of the
mammalia, a nervous organization is attained, whose action
exhibits manifestations of what we call mind. There appears
to be a power of something like reasoning and volition,
because the nervous actions are so various and so much
adapted to outward circumstances. Thus, before we reach
the human animal, we find nervous organizations widely
separated from those of the remote progenitor species, because
they can do so much more, and can do it with an
apparent power of voluntary variation. At last, this process
of modifications accumulating upon modifications culminates
in an animal in whose nervous organization we find
the freest, the most complex, and the most various power
of receiving into his brain the impressions derived from the
external world, and of transmitting from his brain to the
different organs of his body those movements which the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>ternal
circumstances of his life, or his internal efforts, cause
him to strive for and to effect. This animal was the primeval
man.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Looking back, then, to the primal source of all nervous
organization, in the remote animal in which the nervous
structure and action were at the crudest state of development,
and remembering that there was a power of transmitting
it to offspring, and that natural and sexual selection
were unceasingly operating to expand and perfect it, we may
trace the successive stages of its modification and growth,
from the lowest to the highest, until we reach in the primeval
man the highest development that it had yet attained.
But throughout all its stages, from the lowest to the highest,
the system of nervous organization and action is the same
in kind. We do not call its manifestations or action mind,
or speak of them as indicating mind, until we find it developed
into a condition of some voluntary activity and
power of variation, as it is in many of the animals inferior
to man. But in all the animals, man included, mind is the
action of the nervous organization when it evinces a superior
power of variation; and we speak of the brain of such animals
as the seat of mind because that organ is the source to
and from which nervous action proceeds.</p>

<p>Let me now illustrate this view by the acquisition of
articulate speech and the formation of language. In many
of the lower animals with which we are acquainted there is
a power of uttering vocal sounds, and of understanding
them when uttered by their fellows. It must have been a
power possessed by those animals which were the progeni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>tors
of man in the long line of descent of one species from
another. But in them it was a very limited power. It increased
as the nervous organization and the vocal organs
became in the successive species capable of a more varied
action. The sounds of the external world impressed themselves
upon the brains of the primeval men more forcibly
than they did upon the brains of the other animals, and excited
the nervous organization to reproduce or imitate them.
Those emotions and desires which originated in the brain
itself&mdash;the impressions of pain or the sensations of pleasure
experienced in the nervous system&mdash;sought expression
through the vocal organs. Certain sounds repeated alike
by the same individual, or by numerous individuals, for a
long time, became associated in their brains with certain
feelings or sensations. What are called words were thus
formed; which, at first, could have been nothing but the
utterance of certain sounds by the vocal organs, expressing
the sensations felt by the nervous organization, or the imitations
of external noises. At length these vocal sounds are
gathered in the memory, multiplied and systematized, and
a rude language is formed. But, all the while, the first
crude human language was nothing but the result of nervous
action excited to greater activity than in the other
animals, accompanied by nicer and more capable vocal organs
and a greater power of using them. This acquisition,
obtained by the primeval men, was transmitted to their descendants
as an improved physical organization, and in
those descendants it finally reached the marvelous development
of the most perfect languages of antiquity.</p>

<p>Let us now retrace our steps back to the time when
nervous organization, in the successive generations of the
whole animal series regarded as one great family of kindred
animals successively developed out of a common stock, began
to act in such a way as to evince the presence of what
we call mind. Once attained, this improved nervous or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>ganization
would be transmitted by the parents to new individuals;
and so on through countless generations, just as
the offspring would inherit the same physical structure as
the parents in other respects.</p>

<p>Mental phenomena are the products of nervous organization.
We have no means of knowing that mind is an
organism or an entity. If it is an existence capable of surviving
the death of the body, which evolution neither affirms
nor denies, you must go to revelation for the grounds
of belief in its immortality. There is no conflict between
the evolution theory of the nature of mind and the doctrine
of immortality as taught by revealed religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I am not disposed to constitute myself a
champion of revealed religion. I have lately read in the
writings of some well-meaning persons, whose positions and
convictions made them anxious about the truths of revelation,
expressions of the opinion that there is no necessary
conflict between the hypothesis of a revelation and the
teachings of evolution. I have been rather surprised by
such concessions. But through all our discussions, and
throughout all my reflections and inquiries, I have excluded
revealed religion from the number of proofs of our immortality.
But it seems to me that, as to the possibility of a
survival of the mind after the death of the body, you have
stated yourself out of court, not because you have propounded
something that is inconsistent with revelation,
although it certainly is, but because you have made mind
to consist in nothing but the action of nervous organization,
and when that has perished what can remain? You
may say that science does not undertake to determine that
mind is or is not a special existence capable of surviving
the body. But, observe that you attribute to nervous action
the production of phenomena to which you give the name
of mind, when the nervous action evinces some power of
volitional variation and control. Now, when and where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
did this begin, in the long series of animal organisms which
you assume have been successively evolved out of one another?
Remember that, according to the system of evolution,
there are supposed to have been countless forms of
animal organisms, graduating by slow improvements into
higher and higher organisms. Where and when and what
was the first animal that possessed a nervous organization
which would manifest the power of variation in so marked
a degree as to render it proper to speak of the animal as
possessing or evincing mind? Are not the works of naturalists
of the evolution school filled with comparisons of
the minds of different animals, and do they not contend
that in many of them there are manifestations of mental
power, of the exercise of reason and comparison, and a volitional
action according to varying circumstances? Did,
then, these manifestations of something like mental power
begin in the anthropomorphous ape from whom we are supposed
to be descended, or who is supposed to be of kin to
us? Or did it begin in any one and which of the innumerable
intermediate forms between that ape-like creature
and the primeval man? And when once this improved and
improving nervous organization had been developed and
put into a condition to be transmitted to descendants, until
in the primeval man it had attained its highest development,
what was it but a more sensitive, more various, and
complex condition of the substance of which all nervous
tissues are composed? And when these tissues are decomposed
and resolved into their original material elements,
where and what is the mind, whether of man or beast? It
is nowhere and nothing, unless you suppose that the improved
and improving action of the nervous organization at
last developed an existence which is not in itself material
or physical, and which may be imperishable and indestructible,
while the material and physical organs by and through
which it acts for a time perish daily in our sight. If this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
is a possible, it is a very improbable hypothesis, because the
nature of the human mind points to a very different origin.</p>

<p>I surely do not need to tell you that like produces like.
If the mind of man is now a spiritual essence, it is a wild
conjecture to suppose that it was generated out of the action
of a material substance, in whatever animal, or supposed
species of animal, its genesis is imagined to have begun.
We must therefore determine, from all the evidence
within our reach, whether the mind is a spiritual existence.
If it is, it is not difficult to reach a rational conclusion that
its Creator contrived a means of connecting it for a season
with the bodily organs, and made the generative production
of each new individual body at the same time give
birth to a new individual mind, whenever a new child is
born into the world. We can not discover the nature of
the connection, or the process by which generative production
of a new body becomes also generative production of
a new mind. These are mysteries that are hidden from us.
But the fact of the connection&mdash;the simultaneous production
of the new body and the new mind&mdash;is a fact that the
birth of every child demonstrates. Whether the union
takes place at any time before birth, or whether it is only
at birth that the mind, the spiritual essence, comes into existence,
and so may become capable of an endless life, we
can not know. But that this occurs at some time in the
history of every human being, we are justified in saying
that we know.</p>

<p>I shall now contrast your hypothesis of the origin of the
human mind with another and a very different one; and,
in stating it, I shall borrow nothing from the Mosaic account
of the creation of Adam and Eve. I shall not assert,
on the authority of Moses, that God breathed into Adam a
living soul, for that would be to resort to a kind of evidence
which, for the present, I mean to avoid, and which would
bring into consideration the nature of the means by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
the Hebrew historian was informed of the fact which he
relates, and which he could have known in no other way.
It would also give rise to a question of what was meant by
"a living soul." But I shall assume that there is a spiritual
and a material world; that a spiritual existence is one
thing and a material existence is another. I shall assume
that there is a spiritual world, because all our commonest
experience, our introspection and consciousness, our observation
of what the human mind can do, its operations and
its productions, its capacity to originate thought and to
send it down the course of ages, its power to recognize and
obey a moral law as a divine command, the monuments of
every kind which attest that it is something which is not
matter or material substance, prove to us that the human
mind is essentially a spiritual existence; and that while it
acts and must act by and through bodily organs, so long as
it acts in this world, it is a being quite distinct from all
the physical substance and physical organism with which it
is connected for a time. Physiology alone can teach us
this much at least, that mind is not matter; and experience,
consciousness, and observation teach us that while
the action of the mind may be suspended for a time when
the nervous organization can not normally act, from disease
or injury, the mind itself is not destroyed, but its action
may be restored with the restoration of the brain to its
normal condition.</p>

<p>I am going to assume another thing&mdash;the existence of
the Creator, the Supreme Governor of the universe, having
under his control the whole realms of the spiritual and
the material world; alike capable of giving existence to
spiritual entities and to material organisms, and capable
of uniting them by any connection and for any purpose
that might seem to him good. I shall assume this, because
some of you evolutionists concede, if I understand rightly,
the existence and capacities of the Supreme Being, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
you assume, and rightly, that the whole question relates to
his methods; and you believe that he chose the method of
evolution instead of the method of special creation for all
the types of animal life excepting the aboriginal and created
lowest form, out of which all the others have been evolved.
With these two assumptions, then, the nature of a spiritual
existence, and the existence and capacities of the Creator,
I now state to you the opposite hypothesis of the origin and
nature of the human mind.</p>

<p>A pair of human beings, male and female, is created by
the hand and will of the Almighty; and to each is given
a physical organism, and a spiritual, intellectual self, or
mind, which is endowed with consciousness and capable
of thought. Why is this a rational supposition, aside from
any evidence of the fact derived from its assertion by an
inspired or a divinely instructed witness? It is so, because,
when this aboriginal pair of human creatures fulfill the law
of their being, by the procreation of other creatures of the
same kind, the offspring must be supposed to possess whatever
the parents possessed of peculiar and characteristic
organization. This law of transmission is stamped upon all
the forms of organic life; and we may well apply it to the
first pair of human beings. Its operation must have begun
in them and their offspring. Every law that proceeded
from the will of the Supreme Being began to operate at
some time; and this law, like all others, must have been
put in operation by the Creator at some definite period.
He created in the first pair a bodily organization, and he
created in each of them the spiritual entity that we now
call mind, and established its connection with their bodily
organs. He established in them also the power of procreating
offspring; and this included the production of a new
individual of the same species, in whom would be united,
by the same mysterious bond, the same kind of physical
organization and the same kind of spiritual or intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
existence, which is not matter, and could not have been
generated out of matter alone. The beginning of this connection
of body and mind in the first parents was an occasional
and special exercise of the divine power. It was not
a miraculous exercise of power, because a miracle, in the
proper sense, implies some action aside from a previously
established course of things. It was simply a first exercise
of the power in the case of the creation of the first human
pair; that is, it was the establishment in them, specially,
of the union of the body and soul. Its repetition in the
offspring, for all time, and through successive generations,
was left to the operation of the laws of procreation and
heredity. The nature and operation of those laws are
wrapped in mystery; but about the fact of their existence,
and of the compound procreation of a new body and a new
mind at every new birth, there can be no doubt whatever.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this hypothesis has in its favor a
vast preponderance of probability, because&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The generation of mind or spirit out of matter is inconceivable.</p>

<p>2. The creation of mind by the Almighty is just as conceivable
as his creation of a material organism; and the
latter is conceded by all naturalists who admit that there
was a first animal organism; and even some of the evolutionists
hold that the first animal organism was directly
fashioned by the Creator, although all the succeeding organisms
were formed, as they contend, by natural and sexual
selection.</p>

<p>3. The nature of mind&mdash;of the human mind&mdash;is the
same in all individuals of the race. They may differ in
mental power, but they all possess an intellectual principle
that is the same in kind. To the production of mind, or
its formation, the process of evolution was not necessary.
Not only was it unnecessary, but in the nature of things it
was not adapted to do what it is supposed to have done in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
the production of physical organisms. To suppose that the
Creator, instead of the direct exercise of his power of creation,
left it to the material laws of natural and sexual selection
to produce a mind, is to suppose him to have resorted
to a method that was both unnecessary and indirect, and
was furthermore incapable of effecting that kind of product.
In reasoning about the methods of the Creator, it is certainly
irrational to suppose him to have resorted to one that
was so ill adapted to the accomplishment of his object. In
the accomplishment of some physical objects, we may well
suppose that they have been brought about by physical
agencies that have operated very slowly and indirectly; and
we can see that this has often been the case in regard to
many material products. But for the production of mind,
for the accomplishment of a spiritual existence, there can
be imagined no secondary agencies, no gradual growth out
of antecedent existences or substances, no evolution out of
some other and that other a material organism. The first
mind, the first human soul, must have come direct from
the hand and will of God. The succeeding minds may
well have been left to owe their existence to the laws of
procreation, by a process which we can not understand, but
of which we have proof in the birth of every child that has
been born of woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> We now have the two hypotheses of the
origin and nature of the human mind fairly before us; and
here I must point out to you wherein you do injustice to
my side of the question. In the first place, your assumption
of one pair of progenitors of the human race from
whom have diverged all the varieties of the race, does not
encounter the evolution process of man's descent as an animal.
It is either an arbitrary assumption, or it is derived
from the Mosaic account of the creation, which, in a scientific
point of view, and aside from the supposed authority
of that story, is just as arbitrary an assumption as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
book of Genesis had never existed. Take, therefore, Darwin's
hypothesis of the zoölogical series: First, a fish-like
animal, of course inhabiting the water; next, the amphibians,
capable of living in the water and on the land; next,
the ancient marsupials; next, the quadrumana and all the
higher mammals, among whom are to be classed the <i lang="la">Simiadæ</i>
or monkeys; and out of these came the hairy, tailed
quadruped, arboreal in its habits, from which man is descended.
This long line of descent is filled with diversified
forms, intermediate between the several principal forms
which are known to us, and which were successively the
progenitors of man. Now, hear Darwin on the subject of
one pair of progenitors:</p>

<p>"But since he [man] attained to the rank of manhood
he has diverged into distinct races, or, as they may be
more fitly called, sub-species. Some of these, such as the
negro and European, are so distinct that, if specimens had
been brought to a naturalist without any further information,
they would undoubtedly have been considered by him
as good and true species. Nevertheless, all the races agree
in so many unimportant details of structure and in so many
mental peculiarities, that these can be accounted for only
by inheritance from a common progenitor; and a progenitor
thus characterized would probably deserve to rank as
man. It must not be supposed that the divergence of each
race from the other races, and of all from a common stock,
can be traced back to any one pair of progenitors. On the
contrary, at every stage in the process of modification all
the individuals which were in any way better fitted for
their conditions of life, though in different degrees, would
have survived in greater numbers than the less well fitted.
The process would have been like that followed by man,
when he does not intentionally select particular individuals,
but breeds from all the superior individuals and neglects
the inferior. He thus slowly but surely modifies his stock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
and unconsciously forms a new strain. So with respect to
modifications acquired independently of selection, and due
to variations arising from the nature of the organism and
the action of the surrounding conditions, or from changed
habits of life, no single pair will have been modified much
more than the other pairs inhabiting the same country, for
all will have been continually blended through free intercrossing."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The meaning of this is that if you go back to the period
when an animal, by the slow process of modification which
was continually operating among the preceding organisms,
had been raised to the present state of man, and then follow
out the divergencies into the distinct races of men,
those divergencies would not have occurred in consequence
of any one pair having been modified much more than the
other pairs inhabiting the same country, but all the individuals
would have undergone a continually blending process
through unrestrained intercrossing; and those individuals
of both sexes, who became in a superior degree fitted
for their conditions of life, would have survived in greater
numbers than the less well fitted, and would have transmitted
to their posterity those peculiarities which tended
at last to produce different races of the human family. So
that the notion of a single pair of the negro variety, or of
a single pair of the Caucasian variety, formed and completed
as an independent stock, is not necessary to account
for these varieties.</p>

<p>To apply this, now, to the slow production of man's intellectual
faculties, we must, if we would do justice to
Darwin's hypothesis of the method in which he was developed
as an animal, bear in mind that his mental powers,
like his animal structure, have been the necessary acquirement
of new powers and capacities by gradation, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
the perpetual process of modification, and retention and
transmission of the new acquisitions. Darwin, indeed, does
not professedly undertake the genealogy of the human
mind; but he appears to hold the opinion that in future
psychology will be based on the gradual acquisition of each
mental power and capacity, as distinguished from their
complete production in any one pair, or in any one being;
and he refers to Herbert Spencer as having already securely
laid the foundation for this new psychology.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>I take, therefore, the great English naturalist as the
person who has most satisfactorily explained the origin of
man as an animal, and the great English philosopher as
the person who has propounded the most satisfactory theory
of the origin of the human mind. The two hypotheses
run parallel to and support each other. Man, as respects
his mere animal structure, is an organism developed by a
slow process of modification out of preceding organisms.
His mental faculties have one by one grown out of the
operation of the same physical agencies that have formed
his animal structure, and they have not been bestowed at
once upon any one pair, or upon any one individual of the
race. After they have all been acquired, as we now know
and recognize them, they have descended to the successive
generations of the race.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I have studied Mr. Spencer's "System of
Psychology," but I do not know whether we understand it
alike. You say that he has propounded the most satisfactory
theory of the origin of mind. Assuming that mind
was evolved as an aggregate of powers and capacities, slowly
acquired, <i lang="la">pari passu</i> with the evolution of the animal
organism, be good enough to tell me whether Mr. Spencer
does or does not conclude that mind is anything more than
an aggregate of powers and capacities of the nervous organi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>zation.
I am quite aware of the mode in which he meets
the charge of materialism; but waiving for the present the
question of materialism, I should be glad to know, according
to your understanding of his philosophy, what he considers
mind to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> To answer your question requires an analysis
of Spencer's "Principles of Psychology." You have
here on your table the third edition of that work, which
received his latest corrections and additions.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> If you look
at the preface of this edition, you will see that, as between
Realism and Idealism, he enunciates a view which recognizes
an element of truth in each, but rejects the rest. By
this "Transfigured Realism" he aims to conciliate what is
true in Realism with what is true in Idealism; and it is by
this conciliation that he answers the partisans of both systems,
who will not sacrifice any part of their respective doctrines.
It is important for you to remember this in judging
of his psychological system. He begins by a description
of the structure and functions of the nervous system, and
the nature of nervous actions. Without repeating in all
its minute details the structure which he describes, it is
enough to say that in all animals, from the lowest to the
highest, this peculiar part of the organism which we call
the nervous system is composed of two tissues which differ
considerably from those composing the rest of the organism.
In color they are distinguished from one another as
gray and white, and in their minute structures as vesicular
and fibrous. In the gray tissue, the vesicles or corpuscles
contain a soft protein substance, with granules imbedded in
it, consisting of fatty matter. The more developed of these
nerve-corpuscles give off branching processes, and the
terminations of nerve-fibers are distributed among them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
The white tissue is composed of minute tubes containing a
medullary substance or pulp, viscid like oil. Imbedded in
this pulp, which fills the tubes, there lies a delicate fiber or
axis-cylinder, which is uniform and continuous instead of
having its continuity broken by fat-granules. This central
thread is the essential nerve; and the sheath of medullary
matter, and its surrounding membranous sheath, are only
its accessories. While, therefore, the matter of nerve-fiber
has much in common with the matter of nerve-vesicle, in
the latter the protein substance contains more water, is
mingled with fat-granules, and forms part of an unstable
mass; whereas in the former, the nerve-tube, the protein
substance, is denser, is distinct from the fatty compounds
that surround it, and so presents an arrangement that is
relatively stable.</p>

<p>Conceive, then, of this interlaced physical structure extending
throughout the whole organism as a kind of circular
mechanism, having its periphery at the surface of the
body and limbs, ramifying among and into the internal
organs, with various nerve-centers distributed through the
interior mechanism, and the one great nerve-center in the
brain. Conceive of this structure, further, as fed continually
by the blood-vessels, which repair its waste of tissue
and keep it in proper tone and activity. Then imagine it
as first put in operation in some animal in whom it has
become developed as we now know it in ourselves, and let
that animal stand as the primeval man, who has become,
by inherited transmission of gradual accumulations, possessed
of this consummate development of nervous organization.
You can then observe the method of its action, and
can perceive how mind became developed, and what it is.</p>

<p>What I have now given you is only a general description
of the structure of the nervous mechanism, and in order to
understand its functions, we may take it up, in an individual,
at a point of time when it had not experienced a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
movement or change from a state of rest, but when it was
completely fitted to act. Observe, then, that its action will
consist in the origination and accomplishment of motion;
or, in other words, in molecular change of the substance
composing the nerves, which, for illustration only, may be
likened to the conductor through which the molecular disturbance
passes which is popularly, but not scientifically,
called the electric fluid. At the surface of the body and
limbs, the external termini of the nerves are exposed to disturbance
by contact with an external object. Along the
highly sensitive and minute conductor, the nerve which
has by contact with an external object at its outer extremity
received a slight shock, there passes through the fluid
or semi-fluid substance of the nerve a wave of disturbance,
or a succession of such waves. This disturbance reaches
the brain, the great nerve-center, where it becomes a feeling.
In this way is generated the feeling of contact with
an external object, and this is what is commonly called the
sense of touch, which is simply a feeling produced in the
great nerve-center of the brain. Now, to reverse the process,
let us suppose that this feeling, caused by touching an
external object, provokes or excites a desire to remove that
object, or to get rid of the continuance of the feeling, and
to be without the irritation or pain which it is causing.
From the central seat of nervous action, the brain, along
another nerve, there proceeds a wave, or a series of waves,
in the fluid or semi-fluid substance of which the conductor
of that nerve is composed, and motion is communicated to
some muscle or set of muscles, which need to be put in
motion in order to break the contact with the external
object. In like manner, all internal organs of the body,
the viscera, are supplied with a system of nerves connected
with the great nerve-center. If a disturbance arises in one
of the viscera, some action that is abnormal, a sensation
that is called pain is produced. So, too, in regard to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
normal action of the viscera, kept up by involuntary movements&mdash;those
movements originate in and are transmitted
from the nerve-center, by waves in the fluid or semi-fluid
substance of which the special nerves are composed, whose
office it is to cause the necessary movements in the muscular
substance, or the tissue, of the particular organ.</p>

<p>In this way began, in the supposed individual, those
simpler states of feeling which pain or irritation produced
in the nervous system, and those other involuntary movements
which were essential to the normal and unconscious
action of the viscera. These varying conditions of the
highly sensitive nervous system, which constitute and are
rightly denominated feelings, were constantly repeated;
and, so far as they are capable of becoming a part of consciousness,
that consciousness is a repetition of the same
nervous actions many times over. Pass, then, from the
feelings called sensations to the feelings called emotions,
and it will be found that while both are states of nervous
action, the former are peripherally initiated and the latter
are centrally initiated. The meaning of this is that a sensation
is an effect produced at the nerve-center by the transmission,
from the outer terminus of a particular nerve,
of the waves in the fluid or semi-fluid substance of the
nerve. The strong forms of feeling called sensations are
peripherally initiated, and the feelings called emotions are
centrally initiated. Now, any feeling of any kind is directly
known by each person in no other place than his own
consciousness; and the question is, Of what is consciousness
composed? In order to afford an answer to this question,
Mr. Spencer proceeds to examine the substance of
mind, and then passes to a consideration of the composition
of mind. These are not the same thing; for, if
there be no such thing, properly speaking, as the substance
of mind, its composition, or its nature, must be looked for
in another way. The expression "substance of mind," if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
used in any way but that in which we use the <em>x</em> of an algebraic
equation, has no meaning. If we undertake to interpret
mind in the terms of matter, as crude materialism
does, we are at once brought to this result, that we know,
and can know, nothing of the ultimate substance of either.
We know matter only as forms of certain units; but the
ultimate unit, of which the ultimate homogeneous units
are probably composed, must remain absolutely unknown.
In like manner, if mind consists of homogeneous units of
feeling, the ultimate unit, as a substance, must remain unknown.
When, therefore, we think of the substance of
mind, the simplest form under which we can think of it is
nothing but a symbol of something that can never be rendered
into thought, just as the concept we form to ourselves
of matter is but the symbol of some form of power absolutely
and forever unknown to us, as the representation of
all objective activities in terms of motion is only a symbolic
representation, and not a knowledge of them. Symbols of
unknown forms of existence, whether in the case of matter,
motion, or mind, are mere representations which do not
determine anything about the ultimate substance of either.
"Our only course is constantly to recognize our symbols as
symbols only, and to rest content with that duality of them
which our constitution necessitates. The unknowable as
manifested to us within the limits of consciousness in the
shape of feeling, being no less inscrutable than the unknowable
as manifested beyond the limits of consciousness
in other shapes, we approach no nearer to understanding
the last by rendering it into the first."<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Discarding, then, the expression "substance of mind,"
excepting as a mere symbol, Mr. Spencer passes to the
"composition of mind"; and here we reach his explanation
of mind as an evolution traceable through ascending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
stages of composition, conformably to the laws of evolution
in general, so that the composition of mind, as something
evolved out of simple elements, does not need or involve a
symbolical representation in the terms of matter.</p>

<p>The method of composition, by which the whole fabric
of mind is constituted, from the formation of its simplest
feelings up to the formation of the complex aggregates of
feelings which are its highest developments, can now be
sketched. A sensation is formed by the consolidation of
successive units of feeling; but the feelings called sensations
can not of themselves constitute mind, even when
many of different kinds are present together. When, however,
each sensation, as it occurs, is linked in association
with the faint forms of previous sensations of the same
kind, mind is constituted; for, by the consolidation of successive
sensations, there is formed a knowledge of the particular
sensation as a distinct subject of what we call
thought, or the smallest separable portion of thought as
distinguished from mere confused sentiency. Thus, as the
primitive units of feeling are compounded into sensations,
by the same method simple sensations, and the relations
among them, are compounded into states of definite consciousness.
The next highest stage of mental composition
is a repetition of the same process. Take a special object,
which produces in us a vivid cluster of related sensations.
When these are united with the faint forms of like clusters
that have been before produced by such objects, we know
the object. Knowledge of it is the assimilation of the
combined group of real feelings which it excites, with one
or more preceding ideal groups which were once excited
by objects of the same kind; and, when the series of ideal
groups is large, the knowledge is clear. In the same way,
by the connections between each special cluster of related
sensations produced by one object, and the special clusters
generated by other objects, a wider knowledge is obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
By assimilating the more or less complex relations exhibited
in the actions of things in space and time, with
other such complex relations, knowledge of the powers and
habits of things is constituted. If we can not so assimilate
them, or parts of them, we have no knowledge of their
actions. So it is, without definite limit, through those
tracts of higher consciousness which are formed of clusters
of clusters of feelings held together by extremely involved
relations. This law of the composition of mind is, therefore,
the assimilation of real feelings and groups of real
feelings with the ideal feelings or ideal groups of feelings
which objects of the same kind once produced. You can
follow out, without my assistance, the correspondence
which Mr. Spencer exhibits between the views of mental
composition and the general truths respecting nervous
structure and nervous functions with which he began the
treatment of mind, which consists largely, and in one sense
entirely, of feelings. The inferior tracts of consciousness
are constituted by feelings; and the feelings are the materials
out of which are constituted the superior tracts of
consciousness, and thus intellect is evolved by structural
combination. "Everywhere feeling is the substance of
which, when it is present, intellect is the form. And
where intellect is not present, or but little present, mind
consists of feelings that are unformed or but little
formed."<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Does not this statement, which in substance is
Mr. Spencer's explanation of the formation of mind, explain
to you why he denominates it "transfigured realism"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I have attentively and carefully read Mr.
Spencer's book from which you have made this partial
analysis of his view of the nature of mind, but whether it
is realism "transfigured," or whatever is, I think it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
be admitted that its basis is a truly realistic one; for it
comes back at last to just what I suggested to you at the
beginning of this discussion, that mind, according to his
view, is constituted by the action of the nervous system, or,
in other words, that mind consists of the phenomena of
movements which take place in a physical structure. If
this is all that can be predicated of mind, it is not something
that can have an independent and continuous existence
after the dissolution of the physical structure called
the nervous system. That structure is one that is analogous
in its action to the other part of the organism by
which digestion, or the assimilation of food, is carried on.
We might as well suppose that by the action of the digestive
system there has been constituted a something which
will remain as a digestive function after the organs of digestion
have perished, as to suppose that the action of the
nervous system has constituted a something which will remain
mind, a conscious and independent existence, after
the nervous system has been resolved into its original material
elements. Indeed, I do not understand Mr. Spencer's
philosophy as including, providing for, or leading to, any
possible continued existence of the mind after the death of
the body. He seems to exclude it altogether. There is a
passage at the end of one of his chapters which appears to
be a summary of his whole philosophic scheme, and which
is one of the dreariest conclusions I have ever met with.
"Once more," he says, "we are brought round to the conclusion
repeatedly reached by other routes, that behind all
manifestations, inner and outer, there is a Power manifested.
Here, as before, it has become clear that while the nature
of this Power can not be known, while we lack the faculty
of forming even the dimmest conception of it, yet its universal
presence is the absolute fact without which there
can be no relative facts. Every feeling and thought being
but transitory, an entire life made up of such feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
and thoughts being also but transitory, nay, the objects
amid which life is passed, though less transitory, being
severally in course of losing their individualities quickly or
slowly; we learn that the one thing permanent is the Unknowable
Reality hidden under all these changing shapes."<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>I will not say that the mournful character of this hopelessness
of human destiny is proof of its unsoundness. I
have accustomed myself to accept results, whatever may be
the gloom in which they involve us, provided they are deductions
of sound reasoning; and our wishes or hopes can
not change the constitution of the universe or become
important evidence for or against any view of what that
constitution is. But let me ask, what does this philosopher
mean by the transitory character of an entire life made up
of transitory feelings and thoughts, occupied throughout
their continuance with transitory objects, or objects which
are quickly or slowly losing their individualities? What
possible room does he leave for the development and discipline
of an immortal being, supposing that man is an immortal
being, by an entire life passed in feelings, thoughts,
and action about objects which, relatively to the individual,
may, quickly or slowly, pass away from him? Or, what
room does he allow for the effect on such a being of an
entire life spent in the pursuit of objects or the enjoyment
of pleasures which develop only his baser nature and unfit
him for anything else? In any scheme of philosophy
which omits to regard this life as a preparatory school for
some other life, it seems to me that something is left out
which ought to be included, and which ought to be included
for the very reason that the evidence which tends to
show that mind is not constituted as Mr. Spencer supposes,
but that it is an existence of a special character, not generated
by the action of a physical structure, but deriving its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
existence from the direct action of the creating Power, is
so strong that, if we leave this conclusion out of the hypothesis,
we shall have left out the strongest probabilities
of the case. It is no answer to the necessity for including
this conclusion to say that there is a power which
we can not know, or an Unknowable Reality hidden under
all changing manifestations, among which are those
of mind. A study of those manifestations leads rightly to
some conclusions respecting the Power which underlies all
manifestations. It is necessary, therefore, to subject Mr.
Spencer's philosophy of mind to the further inquiry, How
does he account for the moral sense? How does he explain
that part of consciousness which recognizes moral obligations&mdash;the
recognition of moral law and duty? We may
easily dispense with the phrase "substance of the mind,"
if we wish to avoid a term of matter; but if mind is constituted
by the perception of feelings excited in the nervous
system, what is it that perceives? Is there a something
that is reached by the feelings which constitute sensations
in the great nerve-center, which takes cognizance of them,
which combines them into portions of consciousness, or is
consciousness nothing but a succession of sensations, and if
so, what is "thought"? And what is that portion of
thought which takes cognizance of moral duty, and which
shows man to be capable of recognizing and obeying or
breaking a moral law? I have somewhere read a suggestion
that the polity which is said to have been given to the Hebrew
people on the Mount of Sinai, and which is described
as ten statutes written on two tablets of stone, consisted of
five laws on one tablet and five on the other; one set of
them expressing the relations of the Hebrews to the Deity,
and the other being the fundamental laws of the social life
which the Hebrews were commanded to lead. This division
is not accurate, because the commandments which express
the relations of the Hebrews to the Deity are four in num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>ber,
and the commandments which were to constitute their
social law are six. But that there is a line of demarkation
between the two kinds of laws is obvious, and how they
were written on the tablets, or whether they were written
at all, is immaterial. Looking, then, first at the social law,
whether there was more or less of the same ethical character
in the codes of other ancient peoples, or whether the
social law which is said to have been delivered to Moses and
by him communicated to his nation stands as an embodiment
of morality unequaled by anything that had preceded
it, it is certain that it found the Hebrew people capable of
the idea of law as a divine command. It is true that the
corner-stone of the whole superstructure is to be found in
the fact that the several commands which constituted this
social code&mdash;"Honor thy father and thy mother," "Thou
shalt do no murder," "Thou shalt not commit adultery,"
"Thou shalt not steal," "Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbor," "Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor's house," etc.&mdash;were addressed to a people to whose
representatives the Almighty is supposed to have revealed
himself amid "thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud
upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud,
and all the people that were in the camp [below] trembled."
It is also true that the first of these awful annunciations
was said to have been, "I am the Lord thy God, which
brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before [or beside]
me."<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> So that the source whence all the following commands
proceeded was the one and only God, who is described
as having thus revealed himself in fire and cloud
and earthquake, and thus to have secured instant and implicit
faith in what he spoke. But what he is asserted to
have said was addressed to human minds. This is in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
aspect the most important fact in the whole Hebrew history.
It makes no difference whether Moses performed a
piece of jugglery, or whether he actually went within the
fire and the cloud, and actually spoke with God and received
his commands. The indisputable truth remains that
the individual minds of the Hebrew people, whom Moses
had led out of Egypt, received and obeyed, as divine commands,
an original and unique moral code, because they
were so constituted that they could embrace and act upon
the idea of law emanating from another than an earthly or
a human source. What, then, was this constitution of the
human mind, that could thus receive and act upon a divine
command; and what is it now? It matters not, in the view
in which I ask this question, whether there was any deceit
practiced or not, or whether there is any practiced now in
respect to the authority giving the command. What is to
be accounted for is the capacity of the human mind to embrace
and accept the idea of a moral law, be it that of Moses,
or of Christ, or of Mohammed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I am glad that you put this matter of the
ten commandments hypothetically, because otherwise we
might have been led aside into an argument about the authenticity
of the narrative. I recognize, however, the bearing
of the question which you have put, and shall endeavor
to answer it. Your question implies that the essential constitution
of the human mind has been the same in all ages;
that it was the same in this race of nomads, who had been,
they and their fathers for ages, serfs of the Egyptian kings,
that it is in us. Perhaps this assumption may be allowed;
and, at all events, the real question is, How did the idea of
a moral law originate, and what is the sense of moral obligation?
Like all things else, it is a product of the process
of evolution. I shall not argue this by any elaborate reasoning,
but will proceed to state the grounds on which it
rests. I will first give you what I understand to be Dar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>win's
view of the origin of the habit of thinking and feeling,
which we call the moral sense. Primeval man must
have existed in a state of barbarism. When he had become
developed out of some pre-existing animal, he was a mere
savage, distinguishable from his predecessors only by the
possession of some superior degree of mental power. Savages,
like some other animals, form themselves into tribes
or bands. Certain social instincts arise, out of which spring
what are regarded as virtues. Individuals of the tribe begin
to desire the sympathy and approbation of their fellows.
They perceive that certain actions, such as protection of
other and weaker individuals against danger, gain for them
the sympathy and approbation of the tribe. There are thus
formed some ideas of the common advantage to the tribe of
certain actions, and of the common disadvantage of the opposite
actions. Man is eminently a social animal, and this
desire for the sympathy and approbation of his tribe, and
this fear of their disapprobation, is so strong that the individual
savage is led to perceive that the common good of
the tribe is the object at which he must aim to conform.
The first social instincts, therefore, are those which perceive
the relations between certain kinds of conduct and the
common good of the tribe; and out of these relations, with
the aid of increasing intellectual powers, is developed the
golden rule, "As ye would that men should do to you, do
ye to them likewise," which lies at the foundation of morality.
These social instincts, thus leading at last to the
great rule of social morality, are developed very slowly.
They are at first confined to the benefit of the same tribe,
and they have no force in the relations of that tribe to the
members of any other. To a savage it is a highly meritorious
action to save the life of another member of his
own tribe, and if he loses his own life in the effort it is so
much the more meritorious. But he does not extend this
idea of doing a good action to the members of a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
tribe, and, whether his own tribe is or is not at war with the
other tribe, he and his own community will think it no
harm if he murders a member of that other tribe. But as
the approach to civilization goes on&mdash;as man advances in
intellectual power, and can trace the more remote consequences
of his actions, and as he rejects baneful customs
and superstitions, he begins to regard more and more not
only the welfare but the happiness of his fellow-men.
Habit, resulting from beneficial experiences, instruction
and example, renders his sympathies more tender and
widely diffused, until at last he extends them to men of
all races, to the imbecile, maimed, and other useless members
of society, and to the inferior animals. Thus the
standard of morality rises higher and higher; but its origin
is in the social instincts, which spring out of the love of
approbation and the fear of disapprobation.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>But morality comprehends also the self-regarding virtues,
those which directly affect the individual, and which
affect society but remotely and incidentally. How did the
idea of these originate? There is a very wide difference
between the morality of savages, in respect to the self-regarding
virtues, and the morality of civilized nations.
Among the former, the greatest intemperance, utter licentiousness,
and unnatural crimes are very common. But as
soon as marriage was introduced, whether monogamous or
polygamous, jealousy led to the inculcation of female virtue;
and this, being honored, spread to the unmarried
females. Chastity, the hatred of indecency, temperance,
and many other self-regarding virtues, originating first in
the social instincts, have come to be highly prized by civilized
nations as affecting, first, the welfare of the community,
and, secondly, the welfare of the individual. This was
the origin of the so-called "moral sense." It rejects the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
intuitive theory of morality, and bases its origin on the increasing
perception of the advantage of certain conduct to
the community and the individual.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> And in this origin of the social and the
self-regarding virtues, which I understand you to say is the
theory of Darwin, is the idea of a divine command to practice
certain things, and to avoid doing certain other things,
left out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> The idea of a divine command, as the source
of morality, is not necessary to the explanation of the mode
in which the social or the self-regarding virtues were gradually
developed. In the progress from barbarism to civilization,
what is called the moral sense has been slowly developed
as an increasing perception of what is beneficial, and
this has become an inherited faculty. We thus have a sure
scientific basis for the moral intuitions which we do not individually
stay to analyze when we are called upon to determine
the morality or the immorality of certain actions.
The supposed divine command is something that is aside
from the process by which the idea of morality or immorality
became developed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> And is this also Mr. Spencer's philosophy
of the moral sense?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Let me read you what Spencer says: "I
believe that the experience of utility, organized and consolidated
through all past generations of the human race,
has been producing corresponding modifications which, by
continued transmission and accumulation, have become in
us certain <em>faculties</em> of moral intuition&mdash;certain <em>emotions</em>
responding to right and wrong conduct, which have no
<em>apparent</em> basis in the <em>individual</em> experiences of utility."<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
I have emphasized certain words in this passage in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
make its meaning distinct. Mr. Spencer's theory is that
we have certain <em>faculties</em> of moral intuition, which have
become such by transmission and accumulation; that the
original ideas of right and wrong sprang from perceptions
of utility; and that when to the individual the question of
a good or a bad action in others or himself is now presented,
he feels an <em>emotion</em> which responds to right or
wrong conduct, and feels it in the <em>faculty</em> which he has
inherited from ancestors, without referring it to his <em>individual</em>
experience of the utility or inutility of certain conduct.</p>

<p>Now, in regard to the divine command as the origin
of our ideas of right and wrong, if you turn to Mr. Spencer's
"Principles of Sociology," you will find an immense
collection of evidence which shows the genesis of deities of
all kinds. Beginning with the ideas formed by the primitive
men of souls, ghosts, spirits, and demons, the ideas of
another life and of another world, there came about the
ideas of supernatural beings, aided in their development by
ancestor-worship, idol-worship, fetich-worship, animal-worship,
plant-worship, and nature-worship. Hence came the
ideas of deities of various kinds, one class of which is that
of the human personality greatly disguised, and the other
is the class which has arisen by simple idealization and expansion
of the human personality. The last class, although
always coexisting with the other, at length becomes predominant,
and finally there is developed the idea of one
chief or supreme deity. Having traced the origin of this
idea of a supreme deity, Mr. Spencer puts and answers
this question: "While among all races and all regions,
from the earliest times down to the most recent, the conceptions
of deities have been naturally evolved in the way
shown, must we conclude that a small clan of the Semitic
race had given to it, supernaturally, a conception which,
though superficially like the rest, was in substance abso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>lutely
unlike them?"<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> He then proceeds to show that
the Hebrew Jehovah, or God, was a conception that had
a kindred genesis with all the other conceptions of a deity
or deities. "Here," he says, "pursuing the methods of science,
and disregarding foregone conclusions, we must deal
with the Hebrew conception in the same manner as with
all the others." Dealing with it by the scientific method,
he shows that behind the supernatural being of the order
of the Hebrew God, as behind the supernatural beings of
all other orders, there has in every case been a human personality.
Thus, taking the narrative as it has come down
to us of God's dealing with Abraham, he shows that what
Abraham thought, or is described as thinking by those
who preserved the tradition, was of a terrestrial ruler who
could, like any other earthly potentate, make a covenant
with him about land or anything else, or that he was the
maker of all things, and that Abraham believed the earth
and the heavens were produced by one who eats and drinks,
and feels weary after walking. Upon either idea, Abraham's
conception of a Deity remains identical with that
of his modern Semitic representative, and with that of the
uncivilized in general. But the ideas of Deity entertained
by cultivated people, instead of being innate, arise only
at a comparatively advanced stage, as results of accumulated
knowledge, greater intellectual grasp, and higher
sentiment.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>To return now to the supposed divine command as the
origin of morality, it is obvious that the conception of the
being who has uttered the command makes the nature of
the command partake of the attributes ascribed to that being.
Accordingly, the grossest superstitions, the most revolting
practices, the most immoral actions, have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
their sanction in what the particular deity who is believed in
is supposed to have inculcated or required. I do not need
to enumerate to you the proofs of this, or to tell you that
the Hebrew God is no exception to it. One illustration of
it, however, is worth repeating. Speaking of the ceremony
by which the covenant between God and Abraham is said
to have been established, Mr. Spencer says: "Abraham and
each of his male descendants, and each of his slaves, is circumcised.
The mark of the covenant, observe, is to be
borne not only by Abraham and those of his blood, but also
by those of other blood whom he has bought. The mark
is a strange one, and the extension of it is a strange one, if
we assume it to be imposed by the Creator of the universe,
as a mark on a favored man and his descendants; and on
this assumption it is no less strange that the one transgression
for which every 'soul shall be cut off' is, not any
crime, but the neglect of this rite. But such a ceremony
insisted on by a living potentate, under penalty of death, is
not strange, for, as we shall hereafter see, circumcision is
one of various mutilations imposed as marks on subject persons
by terrestrial superiors."<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>So that the Hebrew God who made the covenant with
Abraham was not, in Abraham's own conception, the First
Cause of all things, or a supernatural being, but he was a
powerful human ruler, making an agreement with a shepherd
chief. In all religions, the things required or commanded
by the supposed deified person have been marked
by the characteristics of human rulers; and as a source of
morality, or as a standard of morality, the requirements or
commands of the deified person, however they are supposed
to have been communicated, fail to answer the indispensable
condition of a fixed and innate system of morality, which
is that it must have proceeded from the Creator of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
universe, and not from a being who partakes of human passions,
infirmities, and desires, and is merely a deified human
potentate.</p>

<p>Pass, now, to Mr. Spencer's "Principles of Morality";
and although but one volume of this work has been as yet
published, we may see that he is entirely consistent with
what he has said in his "Sociology" and his other writings.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
He does not leave us in any doubt as to his theory of morals.
It appears, from the preface to his "Data of Ethics," that
he has been compelled by ill-health to deviate from the
plan which he had mapped out for himself, and to publish
one volume of his "Principles of Morality" before
completing his "Principles of Sociology." But while we
have reason for his sake and for the sake of the world to
regret this, we can easily understand his system of morality.
He means to rest the rules of right conduct on a scientific
basis, and he shows that this is a pressing need. In his
preface, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am the more anxious to indicate in outline, if I can not complete,
this final proof, because the establishment of rules of right
conduct on a scientific basis is a pressing need. Now that moral
injunctions are losing the authority given by their supposed sacred
origin, the secularization of morals is becoming imperative. Few
things can happen more disastrous than the decay and death of a
regulative system no longer fit, before another and fitter regulative
system has grown up to replace it. Most of those who reject the
current creed appear to assume that the controlling agency furnished
by it may be safely thrown aside, and the vacancy left unfilled
by any other controlling agency. Meanwhile, those who defend the
current creed allege that, in the absence of the guidance it yields, no
guidance can exist; divine commandments they think the only possible
guides. Thus, between these extreme opponents there is a cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>tain
community. The one holds that the gap left by disappearance
of the code of supernatural ethics need not be filled by a code of
natural ethics; and the other holds that it can not be so filled.
Both contemplate a vacuum, which the one wishes and the other
fears. As the change which promises or threatens to bring about
this state, desired or dreaded, is rapidly progressing, those who believe
that the vacuum can be filled are called upon to do something
in pursuance of their belief.</p></blockquote>

<p>The code of natural ethics which Mr. Spencer propounds,
and which is a product of the process of evolution,
may be summarized as follows: Conduct is an aggregate of
actions which are not purposeless, but which include all
acts that are adjusted to ends, from the simplest to the
most complex. The division or aspect of conduct with
which ethics deals, the behavior we call good or bad, is a
part of an organic whole; but, although inextricably bound
up with acts which are neither good nor bad, it is distinguishable
as comprehending those acts with which morality
is concerned. The evolution of conduct, from the simplest
and most indifferent actions up to those on which
ethical judgments are passed, is what Mr. Spencer means
by the scientific method of investigating the origin of morality.
We must begin with the conduct of all living creatures,
because the complete comprehension of conduct is not
to be obtained by contemplating the conduct of human beings
only. "The conduct of the higher animals as compared
with that of man, and the conduct of the lower animals
as compared with that of the higher, mainly differ in
this, that the adjustments of acts to ends are relatively simple
and relatively incomplete. And as in other cases, so
in this case, we must interpret the more developed by
the less developed. Just as, fully to understand the part
of conduct which ethics deals with, we must study human
conduct as a whole, so, fully to understand human
conduct as a whole, we must study it as a part of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
larger whole constituted by the conduct of animate beings
in general."<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Begin, for example, with an infusorium swimming about
at random, determined in its course not by an object which
it perceives and which is to be pursued or escaped, but apparently
by varying stimuli in its medium, the water. Its
acts, unadjusted in any appreciable way to ends, lead it
now into contact with some nutritive substance which it
absorbs, and now into the neighborhood of some creature
by which it is swallowed and digested. Pass on to another
aquatic creature, which, although of a low type, is much
higher than the infusorium, such as a rotifer. With larger
size, more developed structures, and greater power of combining
functions, there comes an advance in conduct. It
preserves itself for a longer period by better adjusting its
own actions, so that, it is less dependent on the actions going
on around. Again, compare a low mollusk, such as a
floating ascidian, with a high mollusk, such as a cephalopod,
and it is apparent how greater organic evolution is
accompanied by more evolved conduct. And if you pass
then to the vertebrate animals, you see how, along with
advance in structure and functions, there is evolved an advance
in conduct, until at length, when you reach the doings
of the highest of mammals, mankind, you not only
find that the adjustments of acts to ends are both more numerous
and better than among the lower mammals, but you
find the same thing on comparing the doings of the higher
races of men with those of the lower races. There is a
greater completeness of achievement by civilized men than
by savages, and there is also an achievement of relatively
numerous minor ends subserving major ends.</p>

<p>Recollecting, then, what conduct is&mdash;namely, the ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>justment
of acts to ends&mdash;and observing how this adjustment
becomes more and more complete as the organism
becomes more developed, we have to note the order of the
ends to which the acts are adjusted. The first end, the
first stage of evolving conduct, is the further prolongation
of life. The next is that adjustment of acts to ends which
furthers an increased amount of life. Thus far the ends
are complete individual life. Then come those adjustments
which have for their final purpose the life of the
species. Then there is a third kind of conduct, which
results from the fact that the multitudinous creatures
which fill the earth can not live wholly apart from one
another, but are more or less in presence of one another,
are interfered with by one another. No one species can so
act as to secure the greatest amount of life to its individuals
and the preservation of the species&mdash;can make a successful
adjustment of its acts to these ends&mdash;without interfering
with the corresponding adjustments by other creatures
of their acts to their ends. That some may live, others
must die. Finally, when we contemplate those adjustments
of acts to ends which miss completeness, because they
can not be made by one creature without other creatures
being prevented from making them, we reach the thought
of adjustments such that each creature may make them
without preventing them from being made by other creatures.
Let me now quote Mr. Spencer's concrete illustrations
of these abstract statements:</p>

<p>"Recognizing men as the beings whose conduct is most
evolved, let us ask under what conditions their conduct, in
all three aspects of its evolution, reaches its limit. Clearly
while the lives led are entirely predatory, as those of savages,
the adjustments of acts to ends fall short of this highest
form of conduct in every way. Individual life, ill carried
on from hour to hour, is prematurely cut short; the
fostering of offspring often fails, and is incomplete when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
does not fail; and in so far as the ends of self-maintenance
and race-maintenance are met, they are met by destruction
of other beings, of different kind, or of like kind. In
social groups formed by compounding and recompounding
primitive hordes, conduct remains imperfectly evolved in
proportion as there continue antagonisms between the
groups and antagonisms between members of the same
group&mdash;two traits necessarily associated; since the nature
which prompts international aggression prompts aggression
of individuals on one another. Hence, the limit of evolution
can be reached by conduct only in permanently peaceful
societies. That perfect adjustment of acts to ends in
maintaining individual life and rearing new individuals,
which is effected by each without hindering others from
effecting like perfect adjustments, is, in its very definition,
shown to constitute a kind of conduct that can be approached
only as war decreases and dies out.</p>

<p>"A gap in this outline must now be filled up. There
remains a further advance not yet even hinted. For beyond
so behaving that each achieves his ends without preventing
others from achieving their ends, the members of a society
may give mutual help in the achievement of ends. And if,
either indirectly by industrial co-operation, or directly by
volunteered aid, fellow-citizens can make easier for one
another the adjustments of acts to ends, then their conduct
assumes a still higher phase of evolution; since whatever
facilitates the making of adjustments by each, increases the
totality of the adjustments made, and serves to render the
lives of all more complete."</p>

<p>In the outline which I have now given you of the evolution
of conduct, you will perceive the foundation of Spencer's
system of ethics. Actions begin to assume an ethical character&mdash;conduct
becomes good or bad&mdash;when the acts tend to
promote or to prevent the general well-being of the community.
But how is the perception or recognition of this qual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>ity
in an action reached? What is the determining reason
for considering an action good or bad? Obviously, conduct
is considered by us as good or bad according as its aggregate
results to self, or others, or both, are pleasurable or painful.
Mr. Spencer shows that every other proposed standard of
conduct derives its authority from this standard: "No
school can avoid taking for the ultimate moral aim a desirable
state of feeling called by whatever name&mdash;gratification,
enjoyment, happiness. Pleasure somewhere, at some time,
to some being or beings, is an inexpugnable element of the
conception. It is as much a necessary form of moral intuition
as space is a necessary form of intellectual intuition."<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>On this fundamental basis, Mr. Spencer rests his system
of absolute ethics and relative ethics. Relative ethics are
those by which, allowing for the friction of an incomplete
life and the imperfections of existing natures, we may ascertain
with approximate correctness what is the relatively
right. This is often exceedingly difficult, because two cases
are rarely the same in all their circumstances. But absolute
ethics are the ideal ethical truths, expressing the absolutely
right. Such a system of ideal ethical truths, which
must have precedence over relative ethics, is reached only
when there has been, in conformity with the laws of evolution
in general, and in conformity with the laws of organization
in particular, an adaptation of humanity to the social
state, changing it in the direction of an ideal congruity.
But, as in relative ethics, the production of happiness or
pleasure is the aim, however imperfectly accomplished, so
in the ideal state the aim is the same, the difference being
that in the latter the accomplishment of happiness or pleasure
and the exclusion or prevention of pain are complete.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> And do I understand you that in this system
of ethics the idea of a moral law proceeding from and

out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Certainly it is. Did I not just now read to
you from Mr. Spencer's preface his complete rejection of
the supposed sacred origin of moral injunctions, and what
he says of the necessity for the secularization of morals to
take the place of that system which is losing its authority?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Perhaps you may call it denial, although

</div>


<p class="intro">Mr. Spencer's philosophy as a whole&mdash;His psychology, and his system of
ethics&mdash;The sacred origin of moral injunctions, and the secularization
of morals.</p>


<p>A certain honesty and directness of mind prevent
Sophereus from being bewildered by the Spencerian philosophy.
Before his next meeting with the scientist, he has
reviewed the main features of this philosophy as developed
in Mr. Spencer's published works; and he has taken notice
of the warning which Mr. Spencer has given to his readers
in the preface to his "Data of Ethics," that "there will
probably be singled out for reprobation from this volume,
doctrines which, taken by themselves, may readily be made
to seem utterly wrong." There is not much likelihood that
Sophereus will be able, if he is willing, to avail himself of
this "opportunity for misrepresentation" in a discussion
with such a champion of Mr. Spencer's philosophy as the
scientist who explains and defends it, especially as they
have the works before them to refer to. Being thus respectively
equipped for the discussion, the conference between
them proceeds:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Before I give you my convictions respecting
Mr. Spencer's philosophy as a whole, I wish to say something
about the passage which you read from the preface
to his "Data of Ethics," because it is the key to his ethical
system. In the first place, to what does he refer when he
speaks of "the current creed"? When I undertake to investigate
a system of morality, the only "creed" that I care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
about&mdash;the only one that is of any importance&mdash;is that
which accepts, as a matter of belief, the existence of the
Creator and Supreme Governor of the universe, from whose
infinite will and purposes have proceeded certain moral as
well as physical laws. This, I take it, is the "creed" of
which Mr. Spencer speaks; the one which assigns moral
injunctions to the will of a Supreme Lawgiver as "their
supposed sacred origin." It is to this creed that he opposes
his "secularization of morals," which must take the place
of their supposed sacred origin, because the authority of
the latter is rapidly dying out of the world. It is this
"creed" which is rejected by those who "assume that the
controlling agency furnished by it may be safely thrown
aside, and the vacancy left unfilled by any other agency."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there are and always have been numerous
persons who appear practically to think that the sacred
origin of morality can be safely rejected, and that the vacancy
may be left unfilled by any other restraining agency.
The deliberate and willful murderer, the burglar, the adulterer,
and many of the other criminal classes, not only appear
to reject "the current creed," but they would be very
glad to have it assumed that there is no other restraining
agency to take its place. So, too, there are persons who
break no moral law, whose lives are pure, but who, having
theoretically persuaded themselves that there is no sacred
origin of moral injunctions, omit to provide, for themselves
or others, any other controlling agency to fill the vacuum.
But this latter class is not very numerous; and if, without
meaning any offense to them, their number is added to that
of the criminal classes, to make up the aggregate of those
who reject "the current creed," we have not a very large
body compared with the whole body of persons in civilized
communities who adhere to "the current creed," who live
by it, and who think that others should live by it too, as
the ultimate foundation of those social laws which take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
cognizance of men's conduct toward one another. So that
I do not quite understand the assertion that "moral injunctions
are losing the authority given by their supposed
sacred origin"; connected as it is with the other assertion
that society is "rapidly progressing" to that vacuum which
is to follow the complete rejection of the one guide without
the substitution of another in its place. I am quite aware
that there has been of late years an increasing amount of
what is called infidelity, or unbelief, or atheism. But I
am quite sure that there has not been a general theoretical
or practical rejection of so much of the religious creed of
mankind as assigns to the will of a supreme and supernatural
lawgiver certain moral injunctions. If we confine
our view to Christendom alone, it is certain that the growth,
activity, and influence of the various religious bodies are not
materially checked, and that religious beliefs are not by any
means losing their hold upon great multitudes of people.
If we survey the regions where the Mohammedan faith prevails,
the same general result is found, whatever Christians
may think of the beliefs or practices of that vast body of
the human race. And, even when we penetrate among the
races which are less civilized, we find very few races or
tribes in which there does not prevail some idea of some
kind of command proceeding from some deity or other,
whatever we may think of the character of that deity or of
the nature of the command.</p>

<p>But I presume that Mr. Spencer meant to confine his
assertion of the necessity for a secularization of morals, and
his assumption that their sacred origin is rapidly passing
away from men's beliefs, to the state of society as it exists
now in Western civilization; and my observation of this
portion of the world is, that those who reject what I presume
he means by "the current creed" are, first, a class
of theorizers: and, secondly, the criminal classes; and that
the aggregate of the two is not, after all, so formidable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
we ought to conclude that the regulative system of the
sacred origin of moral injunctions is "no longer fit" for
any practical purpose. I do not, therefore, recognize what
he considers the supreme practical necessity for "the secularization
of morals" to take the place of a system which
is worn out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You have left out of the case a very important
element. Mr. Spencer antagonizes those who reject
the current creed against those who defend it. The former,
while they reject the current creed, do not recognize
the necessity for any other controlling agency. The latter,
while they defend the current creed, maintain that nothing
can take its place as a regulating agency. Between
them they create a vacuum, which one class wishes for
and the other fears. This is the vacuum which he says
can be and must be filled by the secularization of morals.
It is a vacuum in philosophical speculation about the origin
of morality, and, when the conclusion is reached, it becomes
a practical and pressing question how it is to be carried out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Precisely; and, when the conclusion is
reached, it is to be carried out in legislation and government,
or else the conduct of men toward one another in
society is not to be regulated by public authority at all, but
is to be left to each man's perception of what will produce
the greatest amount of pleasure and happiness, or the least
amount of pain and misery. Now, it is pretty important to
settle at the outset whether those who defend the current
creed are right or wrong when they say that nothing which
will answer the same purpose can be found to take its place.
They constitute one of the classes who will be responsible
for the supposed vacuum; and their share in that vacuum,
their contribution to it, if I may use such an expression,
consists in their assertion that nothing of any value can
take the place of the sacred origin of moral injunctions.
The practical test of whether they are right or wrong is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
be found in legislation. Let us suppose, then, a legislative
assembly in which there is a proposal to change the law of
murder, or to do away with it altogether. A member who
does not believe in any sacred origin of the command
"Thou shalt do no murder," moves not only to abolish the
death-penalty, but to abolish all legal definition of the
crime, and leave every man to be restrained by the consciousness
that, if he takes the life of another, he will cause
a great deal of pain and misery to the relations and friends
of that person. The mover argues that "the current
creed" of morality is worn out; is "no longer fit," as a
regulator; and that the safest and best regulator is the perception
of the beneficial effects of actions of kindness and
good-will, and of the disastrous effects of cruelty and malice.
He is answered by one who defends the current creed, and
who maintains that, as human nature is constituted, the
utilitarian system of morals can not take the place of the
sacred origin as the ultimate foundation of social relations.
But the majority of the assembly think that the mover of
the proposition has the best of the argument, and they proceed
to "secularize" morals by passing his bill doing away
with the law of murder altogether. I am not obliged to
extend my travels anywhere, where I do not care to go,
and I confess I should not like to visit that country after it
had thus "secularized" morality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Now just be careful to note that this whole
science of conduct&mdash;the science of ethics&mdash;the foundation
of right and wrong, is a product of evolution. As in the
development of organisms the higher and more elaborate
are reached after a great length of time, as in mechanics
knowledge of the empirical sort evolves into mechanical
science by first omitting all qualifying circumstances and
generalizing in absolute ways the fundamental laws of
forces, so empirical ethics evolve into rational ethics by first
neglecting all complicating incidents and formulating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
laws of right action apart from the obscuring effects of
special conditions. There are thus reached, after a great
lapse of time, those ideal ethical truths which express the
absolutely right. Mr. Spencer treats of the ideal man
among ideal men; the ideal man existing in the ideal social
state. "On the evolution hypothesis," he says, "the two
presuppose one another; and only when they coexist can
there exist that ideal conduct which absolute ethics has to
formulate, and which relative ethics has to take as the
standard by which to estimate divergences from right, or
degrees of wrong."<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> But, again, observe that society is
now in a transition state; the ultimate man has not yet
been reached; the evolution of ethics is, however, going
on, retarded as it may be by various frictions arising from
imperfect natures. But there is in progress an adaptation
of humanity to the social state, and the ultimate man will
be one in whom this process has gone so far as to produce
a correspondence between all the promptings of his nature
and all the requirements of his life, as carried on in society;
so that there is an ideal code of conduct formulating the
behavior of the completely adapted man in the completely
evolved society.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> But I understand that we have already
reached, or are very soon to reach, a condition of things in
which the supposed sacred origin of moral injunctions is
now, or very shortly will become, no guide. We are to fill
the vacuum which is caused, or is about to be caused, by
its disappearance, by substituting as the standard of right
and wrong the perceptions which we can have of the effects
of actions upon the sum total of happiness, because
this will be the sole standard in the ideal state of society
in which the ideal man will ultimately find himself. I
will not insist on the total depravity of man's nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
because I never borrow an argument from theologians.
But it has been one of the conclusions that I have drawn
from some study of human nature, that it requires very
strong restraints. Not only must some of the restraints
be of the strongest kind, but they must be simple, positive,
and adapted to the varying dispositions and intelligence
of men. There can not well be imagined any
restraining moral force so efficacious as that which is derived
from a belief that the Creator of the universe has
ordained some moral laws; has specialized certain conduct
as right and certain conduct as wrong, without regard to
varying circumstances. As the foundation of all that part
of legislation that takes cognizance of the simpler relations
of men to one another&mdash;those relations which are always
the same&mdash;the sacred origin of moral injunctions is of far
greater force than the perception of the greatest-happiness
principle can possibly be. If a man is tempted to commit
murder, is he not far more likely to be restrained by a law
which he knows will punish him without regard to the
misery he would cause to the friends and relatives of the
person whom he is tempted to kill, than he would be if the
law were based on the latter consideration alone? Do away
with all legislation which punishes the simpler crimes first
and foremost because they break the laws of God, and substitute
as the restraining agency individual recognition of
the effect of actions upon the sum total of happiness, and
you would soon see that one of two consequences would
follow: either you would have no criminal code at all, or
it would be one that would be governed by the most fluctuating
and uncertain standards. Moreover, how is the transition
from the sacred source of the simpler moral injunctions
to the secularization of morals to be effected? I once
heard a wise person say that if a thing is to be done, an ingenious
man ought to be able to show how it is to be done.
I suppose the secularization of morals means the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
renovation of our ideas of right and wrong, by taking as
the sole standard the pleasure or pain, the happiness or unhappiness,
which actions will produce. How are you going
to reach this ideal state? The vacuum is rapidly coming
about. How are you going to take the first step in filling
it? Before the vacuum is complete, you must do something.
You have waited until the evolution of conduct of
the purely utilitarian type has made some great advances;
but the ideal state is not yet reached by all men. You wish
to hasten its approach, and you must begin to act. There
is nothing for you to do but to formulate the new moral
code and put it in operation. You must make your laws&mdash;if
you continue to have laws&mdash;so that murder and lying
and theft will not be punished because the Almighty has
prohibited them, but they will be punished simply because
they produce misery. Do you think you would ever see
every individual of such a community brought to an ideal
congruity between all the promptings of his nature and all
the requirements of his life, as carried on in society? That
you would have nothing but "the completely adapted man
in the completely evolved society"? I fancy that you
would often have to fall back upon the sacred origin of
moral injunctions, and to punish some conduct because it
breaks a law of divine authority. I may have been too
much in the habit of looking at things practically; but I
have not yet discovered that the feeling of obligation, the
sense of duty, what is recognized as moral obligation, having
its origin in some command, and enforced by some kind
of compulsion, can be dispensed with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I must refer you to Mr. Spencer's explanation
of the fact that the sense of duty or moral obligation
fades away as the moral motive emerges from all the political,
religious, and social motives, and frees itself from the
consciousness of subordination to some external agency.
He does not shrink from the conclusion because it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
startling. He tells us that it will be to most very startling
to be informed that "the sense of duty or moral obligation
is transitory, and will diminish as fast as moralization increases."
He fortifies his position thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Startling though it is, this conclusion may be satisfactorily defended.
Even now progress toward the implied ultimate state is
traceable. The observation is not infrequent that persistence in
performing a duty ends in making it a pleasure, and this amounts
to the admission that, while at first the motive contains an element
of coercion, at last this element of coercion dies out, and the act is
performed without any consciousness of being obliged to perform
it. The contrast between the youth on whom diligence is enjoined,
and the man of business so absorbed in affairs that he can not be induced
to relax, shows us how the doing of work, originally under
the consciousness that it <em>ought</em> to be done, may eventually cease to
have any such accompanying consciousness. Sometimes, indeed,
the relation comes to be reversed; and the man of business persists in
work from pure love of it when told that he ought not. Nor is it
thus with self-regarding feelings only. That the maintaining and
protecting of wife by husband often result solely from feelings directly
gratified by these actions, without any thought of <em>must</em>; and
that the fostering of children by parents is in many cases made an
absorbing occupation without any coercive feeling of <em>ought</em>; are
obvious truths which show us that even now, with some of the
fundamental other-regarding duties, the sense of obligation has
retreated into the background of the mind. And it is in some degree
so with other-regarding duties of a higher kind. Conscientiousness
has in many outgrown that stage in which the sense of a
compelling power is joined with rectitude of action. The truly
honest man, here and there to be found, is not only without thought
of legal, religious, or social compulsion, when he discharges an
equitable claim on him; but he is without thought of self-compulsion.
He does the right thing with a simple feeling of satisfaction
in doing it; and is, indeed, impatient if anything prevents him
from having the satisfaction of doing it.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, with complete adaptation to the social state,
that element in the moral consciousness which is expressed by the
word obligation will disappear. The higher actions required for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
the harmonious carrying on of life will be as much matters of course
as are those lower actions which the simple desires prompt. In their
proper times and places and proportions, the moral sentiments will
guide men just as spontaneously and adequately as now do the sensations.
And though, joined with their regulating influence when
this is called for, will exist latent ideas of the evils which non-conformity
would bring, these will occupy the mind no more than do
ideas of the evils of starvation at the time when a healthy appetite
is being satisfied by a meal.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> There is a religion in the world called Christianity,
with which we are tolerably familiar. It comprehends
a system of morality which, when completely observed,
develops the truly good man, the man who does the right
thing with a feeling of satisfaction in doing it, and brings
about those higher actions which are required for the harmonious
carrying on of life, as matters of course, just as surely
as the same result can be brought about by the most ideal
secularization of morals that any philosophical theories can
accomplish. Whatever may be the evidences by which the
sacred origin of Christianity is supposed to be established,
it is certain that this religion does not omit, but on the
contrary it presupposes and asserts, as the foundation of
its moral code, that the sense of obligation to which it
appeals is the consciousness of obligation to obey divine
commands. It proceeds upon the idea that human nature
stands in need of some coercion; that the sense of obligation
is not to be allowed to retreat into the background of
the mind, but that a sense of the compelling power must
be kept joined with rectitude of action, otherwise there
will be a failure of rectitude. It is considered, I believe,
that the adaptation of the Christian morality to the whole
nature of man, by means of the compelling power, the
consciousness of which is not to be transitory, but is to be
universal and perpetual, is very strong proof that this religion
came from a being who understood human nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
better than we can understand it. However this may be,
it is, at all events, certain that the scheme of Christian
morality proceeds upon the necessity for a more efficacious
regulator of human conduct than the simple feeling of satisfaction
in doing right, or the feeling of dissatisfaction in
doing wrong; and, although the true Christian is, in completeness
of moral character, like Mr. Spencer's ideal man,
and although a society completely Christian would be that
ideal social state in which there would be perfect congruity
between the lives of men and the welfare of that society,
yet the Christian religion, if I understand it rightly, does
not assume that there will be more than an approximation
to that universal state of perfection while the human race
remains on earth. The proof of this is to be found in the
fact that this religion does not contemplate a time when
divine command is to cease as the restraining agency on
earth; but, on the contrary, it appears to assume that obedience
to the divine will is to continue in another life to be
a perpetual motive, as it has been in this life. All this
may be without such proof as "science" demands, but it
is certain that the scheme of Christian morality is based
upon the idea that the Creator has made obedience to his
laws, because they are his laws, the great regulator of
human conduct. If the Creator had so made men that
the consciousness of the effect of conduct on the happiness
or misery of our fellow-men would be sufficient as a
regulator, it is rational to conclude that he would not
have imposed commands which were to be obeyed because
they are commands. However great may be the approximation
to a complete adaptation of the social state, I
do not look forward to the disappearance of that element
in the moral consciousness which is expressed by the word
obligation, because obligation, in its ultimate sense, is
obedience to a higher power. Obedience for its own
sake, obedience because there is a command, irrespect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>ive
of all the reasons for the command, is a law which is
illustrated in very many of the relations of life. A wise
parent will sometimes explain to his child why he commands
some things and prohibits others; but if he means
to train that child in the way he should go, he will sometimes
require him to obey for the mere purpose of teaching
him that obedience without question or inquiry is a law of
his nature. A master of a vessel, which is in peril at sea,
gives an order to the sailors. They may or may not understand
the reasons for it. But what sort of sailors would
they be if they did not act upon the consciousness that
unquestioning obedience is the law of their relation to the
ship?</p>

<p>In the earliest traditions that we have of the human
race, as those traditions are accepted by the Western nations,
we find a pretty striking and very simple instance of
this law of obedience. The first pair of human beings are
placed in a garden where they are at liberty to eat of the
fruit of every tree save one, but of that one their Creator
absolutely forbids them to partake. He assigns to them no
reason for the prohibition, but he lays upon them his absolute
command, on the penalty of death if they are disobedient.
One of them begins to reason about the matter&mdash;an
allegorical creature or being, called the serpent, tempting
her with certain advantages that she will get from eating
this particular fruit. She yields, disobeys, and persuades
her husband to do the same. The consequences follow, as
their Creator told them they would. The law of obedience
which this story illustrates has been in operation through
all the ages, and society can no more dispense with it than
it can dispense with any of the physical laws that govern
the universe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Are you going back to the fables for the sacred
origin of moral injunctions? I thought you had got
beyond that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I use an illustration wherever I find it. I
am perfectly content that you should call the story of Adam
and Eve a fable, but the law of obedience which it illustrates
is a tremendous fact. The incident, fable or no
fable, is eminently human, and it is occurring every day in
human experience. It is not strange that the first Hebrew
tradition should have been one that illustrates in so simple
a manner the existence of the law of obedience. In like
manner, it is not strange that the Christian system of ethics
should have been based on the existence of this same law of
obedience to commands. This Christian system of ethics
has dispensed with a great many minute observances which
one branch of the Semitic race believed were imposed upon
them as commands by their Creator; but it has not displaced
the law of obedience, or dispensed with certain moral
injunctions as divine commands, for it proceeds upon the
great truth that human nature requires that kind of restraint,
and that there are certain actions which can not be
left without it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Mr. Spencer has anticipated you. Your reference
to Christianity is not happy. Having gone through
with the explanation of the evolution process in the development
of the highest conception of morals, and having
shown that what now characterizes the exceptionally highest
natures will eventually characterize all, he has something
to say about the reception of his conclusions, to which, as
you have referred to the Christian system of morals, you
would do well to attend:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>§ 98. That these conclusions will meet with any considerable acceptance
is improbable. Neither with current ideas nor with current
sentiments are they sufficiently congruous.</p>

<p>Such a view will not be agreeable to those who lament the
spreading disbelief in eternal damnation, nor to those who follow
the apostle of brute force in thinking that because the rule of the
strong hand was once good it is good for all time; nor to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
whose reverence for one who told them to put up the sword is shown
by using the sword to spread his doctrine among heathens. From
the ten thousand priests of the religion of love, who are silent when
the nation is moved by the religion of hate, will come no sign of
assent; nor from their bishops who, far from urging the extreme
precept of the Master they pretend to follow, to turn the other cheek
when one is smitten, vote for acting on the principle&mdash;strike lest ye
be struck. Nor will any approval be felt by legislators who, after
praying to be forgiven their trespasses as they forgive the trespasses
of others, forthwith decide to attack those who have not trespassed
against them; and who, after a Queen's speech has invoked "the
blessing of Almighty God" on their councils, immediately provide
means for committing political burglary.</p>

<p>But though men who profess Christianity and practice paganism
can feel no sympathy with such a view, there are some, classed as
antagonists to the current creed, who may not think it absurd to
believe that a rationalized version of its ethical principles will eventually
be acted upon.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> "Our withers are unwrung." I am not a
believer in eternal damnation; I am not an apostle of brute
force; I am not in favor of using the sword to spread a religion
of love; I am not a priest or a bishop, nor am I a
member of Parliament or of any other legislative body. I
am a simple inquirer, endeavoring to ascertain the soundness
of certain systems of philosophy. If there are men
who profess Christianity and practice paganism, I do not
see that this fact should deter me from estimating the nature
of the Christian religion, as I would endeavor to estimate
the character of any other religion. It is no concern
of mine whether men who profess Christianity and practice
paganism can feel any sympathy with Mr. Spencer's views.
The question for me is whether <em>I</em> can feel any sympathy
with his views. I will, therefore, go on to tell you why I
do not believe that a merely "rationalized version" of the
ethical principles of Christianity will take the place of those
divine injunctions on which the ethics of Christianity are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
primarily based. Observe, now, that I do not enter upon
the proofs of the divine authority or the divine nature of
Christ. I point to nothing but the fact that the Christian
ethics presuppose a divine and superhuman origin of moral
injunctions. About the fact that they presuppose and assume
the sacred origin of moral injunctions, there can be
no controversy. We read that the question was put to
Jesus, "What commandment is first of all?" and the answer
was, "The first is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God,
the Lord is one; and thou shalt love thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength. The
second is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
There is none other commandment greater than these."<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
The person who made this answer may or may not have
been a divinely commissioned teacher, but, whatever he was,
the question that was put to him was a very searching one,
and both question and answer assume two things: first, that
there is a being, man, to whom commands are addressed;
secondly, that there is a being, God, by whom commands
are given. Jesus undertakes to inform those who questioned
him, what are the two commandments than which
there are none greater addressed to human beings; and in
this answer he covers the existence of man as one being and
the existence of God as another being. In any scheme of
philosophy which ignores the existence of these two beings&mdash;ignores
the existence of man as a being capable of receiving
and acting upon a command, and the existence of a
being capable of addressing a command to man&mdash;there must
necessarily be a great defect; not because Jesus, a supposed
divinely commissioned teacher, assumed that there are two
such beings, but because without the hypothesis of their
existence there can be no ethical system whatever. The
crucial test of the soundness of Mr. Spencer's philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
is, therefore, whether he negatives the existence of man and
the existence of God.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, there is a certain kind of consistency and
completeness in Mr. Spencer's whole philosophy. Beginning
with biology, he traces all organized life back to the
original molecules of organizable matter, and he makes man,
in his physical structure, a product of successive modifications
of organisms out of one another, by simple generation.
This ignores the Creator as a being specially fashioning
the human animal, which Mr. Spencer thinks is a conception
too grossly anthropomorphic to stand the slightest scientific
scrutiny. He then takes up what he calls "psychology,"
and deals with what he considers the origin and
nature of the human mind. He makes consciousness to
consist in tracts of feeling in the nervous organization. He
denies that mind is an entity, a being, perceiving and recognizing
ideas suggested by the impressions produced upon
the nervous organization by external objects. According
to his psychological system, there is no <em>ego</em>, no person, no
thinking being, behind the sensations and feelings in the
nerve-center, and to whom the nerve-center suggests ideas.
Rejecting the hypothesis of such a being, Mr. Spencer
treats of the composition of mind; and he makes it consist,
not in a being, but in components of feelings produced by
the molecular changes of which nerve-corpuscles are the
seats, and the molecular changes transmitted through fibers.
He does not regard the ultimate fabric of mind as a thing
admitting of any inquiry. He says that its proximate components
can be investigated, and that these are feelings and
the relations between feelings. This "method of composition
remains the same throughout the entire composition
of mind, from the formation of its simplest feelings up to
the formation of those immense and complex aggregates
of feelings which characterize its highest development."
Here, then, we must stop. We are not to conceive of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
as an organized entity, or as an organism; or as a something
in which certain powers inhere, and which affords a
field for their action. We may talk of a "thread of consciousness,"
meaning aggregates of feelings produced by
successive waves of molecular change in the nerve-corpuscles,
but we may not talk of "consciousness" as perception
by a conscious subject. We may talk of feelings, but not
of a subject that feels. Mind, then, is not an existence
apart from physical organization. Its phenomena are products
of our corporeal organization. Man is not a person;
and, if he is not, how he is to have a sense of obligation,
how there is to be any intuitional idea of right and wrong,
in the sense of a command or an injunction addressed by
one being to another, I do not understand. Mr. Spencer
does not help me to understand this, and obviously he does
not intend to, because he denies it absolutely. His system
of ethics plainly ignores it; and to that I now pass.</p>

<p>He makes conduct consist in the adjustment of actions
to ends. Good conduct is when the actions are adjusted
to the ends of producing all the pleasure and happiness
that they can be made to bring about. Bad conduct is
when the actions produce only pain or misery to some one,
or there is not a proper adjustment of them to the end of
happiness. Beginning, as you described it in our last conference,
with the lowest orders of animals, the conduct of
man is the same adjustment of actions to ends that it is in
them; the difference being, in the case of man, that as an
animal he has a greater and more varied power of complete
adjustment of his actions to wider and more comprehensive
ends than any other animal. These wider and more comprehensive
ends consist in the full accomplishment of happiness
and pleasure to other beings. This, according to
Mr. Spencer, is impliedly admitted by those who assert the
sacred origin of moral injunctions; for, when pressed for
the reason why moral injunctions have been given, all mor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>alists,
he says, admit that the ultimate moral aim is a desirable
state of feeling, gratification, enjoyment, happiness
to some being or beings. That the welfare of society is <em>one</em>
of the moral aims which moral injunctions of the sacred
order were designed to accomplish, so far as special injunctions
are believed to have been given, is plain enough.
But that this congruity between the divine commands and
the happiness of others&mdash;the useful effect of such commands&mdash;comprehends
the whole purpose of such commands, is the
ultimate and sole reason for their being given, so far as they
are believed to have been given, may be disproved without
difficulty. For example, an individual may be an utterly
worthless person, a curse to his relatives and friends and to
society, irreclaimably sunk in vice and misery, a mere cumberer
of the ground. To kill him will produce no unhappiness
to any one, but will be a positive relief and benefit.
According to "the current creed," there stands a sacred
injunction, "Thou shalt do <span class="smcap">NO</span> murder." This is accepted
as an absolute, fixed, eternal canon of the divine will. You
are not to take upon yourself individually to determine, by
any standard of utility applied to a particular case, that you
can rightfully kill a human being. A miser is alone in the
world. I can steal his hoarded gold, and apply it to good
objects. There stands the command, "Thou shalt <em>not</em>
steal." For no purpose, for no object whatever, for no end
whatever, shall you commit a theft. "Society," to borrow
a phrase of one of the strongest men of our time, "would go
all to pieces in an hour" if it were to adopt only the utilitarian
standard of morality, and to reject the sacred origin
of moral injunctions.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The reception of that sacred origin&mdash;the
belief in it&mdash;implies that man is a being capable of
receiving and obeying a divine command. The existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
of such a being is negatived by Mr. Spencer's psychological
system. That he equally negatives the existence of God as
a being capable of giving, and who has given, moral injunctions
to man, is apparent throughout his whole scheme
of philosophy. According to that philosophy, there is
nothing in the universe but an Omnipotent Power, which
underlies all manifestations. To ascribe a personality to
that Power is a relic of the primitive beliefs of barbarians,
and it is one that is rapidly dying out of the conceptions of
educated men.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no room in Mr. Spencer's philosophy
for any moral intuitions, such as are implied in the
hypothesis that man was placed under an obligation to
obey his Creator, and made capable of recognizing that
obligation. I can perceive no other ultimate foundation
for a system of ethics. As to the idea that we can make a
system of ethics which is to relegate to individual judgment
the adaptability of actions to produce complete happiness,
and to have no other standard of right and wrong,
we might as well at once act upon the maxim that the
end justifies the means, and leave every man to determine
that the end is a good one; and, therefore, the action is
good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> How do you justify the death-penalty which
is inflicted by society? Have you any justification for it,
excepting the claim that it is a useful restraint?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> When society acts judicially in the punishment
of crime, it inflicts such punishments as experience
shows will prevent, or tend to prevent, others from committing
that crime. Its authority to punish with death
or some other penalty is founded, primarily, in regard to
the simpler crimes, such as murder, theft, adultery, false
testimony, etc., on the divine prohibition, which a belief
in the sacred origin of certain special moral injunctions
leads it to accept; and, secondly, on the general welfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Eliminate from the ethical code all belief
in the sacred origin of moral injunctions, and confine the
judicial action of society to the merely utilitarian effect of
individual conduct, and you will surrender the whole criminal
code to the doctrine that the individual who does a certain
act is to be punished or not to be punished, according
to the effect of his act on the person or persons who are
immediately or remotely affected by it. It is because of
Mr. Spencer's negation of man's intuitive sense of obligation
to obey divine commands, because of his peculiar system
of "psychology," that I can not accept the system to
which he gives the name of "ethics." He ought to have
invented a new term for his science of mind. "Psychology,"
according to its derivation, and as it is used in the
English language, means discourse or treatise on the human
soul, or the doctrine of man's spiritual nature. If he has
no spiritual nature, no soul, what does this philosopher
mean by entitling his work "The Principles of Psychology"?
It seems to me that in this use of a term which implies
something that he labors to show does not exist, he is
not quite consistent, for he certainly does not mean to admit
that man has a soul, in the sense in which the learned world
have generally used the term "psychology." But, not to
stickle for verbal criticisms, I will endeavor to give you my
conception of his "scientific" analysis of the mind, and to
contrast it with the other analysis, which seems to me to be
better supported.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Take care that you do not misrepresent him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I shall take the utmost care to represent
him in the only sense in which I can understand him; and,
if I do not represent him accurately, you will correct me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
Take, in the first place, the following passage, in which he
defines the only <em>ego</em> that has any existence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That the <em>ego</em> is something more than the passing group of feelings
and ideas is true or untrue according to the degree of comprehension
we give to the word. It is true if we include the body and
its functions; but it is untrue if we include only what is given in
consciousness.</p>

<p>Physically considered, the <em>ego</em> is the entire organism, including
its nervous system; and the nature of this <em>ego</em> is predetermined:
the infant had no more to do with the structure of its brain than
with the color of its eyes. Further, the <em>ego</em>, considered physically,
includes all the functions carried on by these structures when
supplied with the requisite materials. These functions have for
their net result to liberate from the food, etc., certain latent
forces. And that distribution of these forces shown by the activities
of the organism, is from moment to moment caused partly by
the existing arrangement of its parts and partly by the environing
conditions.</p>

<p>The physical structures thus pervaded by the forces thus obtained,
constitute that substantial <em>ego</em> which lies behind and determines
those ever-changing states of consciousness we call mind.
And while this substantial <em>ego</em>, unknowable in ultimate nature, is
phenomenally known to us under its statical form as the organism,
it is phenomenally known under its dynamical form as the energy
diffusing itself through the organism, and, among other parts,
through the nervous system. Given the external stimuli, and the
nervous changes with their correlative mental states depend partly
on the nervous structures and partly on the amount of this diffused
energy, each of which factors is determined by causes not in consciousness
but beneath consciousness. The aggregate of feelings
and ideas constituting the mental <em>I</em>, have not in themselves the
principle of cohesion holding them together as a whole; but the <em>I</em>
which continually survives as the subject of these changing states
is that portion of the Unknowable Power which is statically conditioned
in special nervous structures pervaded by a dynamically-conditioned
portion of the Unknowable Power called energy.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>It is now necessary to translate this; and in translating
it, it is necessary to attend to the meaning of words. Let
us begin with the first proposition comprehended in this
statement: "That the <em>ego</em> is something more than the
passing group of feelings and ideas, is true or untrue according
to the degree of comprehensiveness we give to the
word. It is true if we include the body and its functions;
but it is untrue if we include only what is given in consciousness."
The natural antithesis would have been to
contrast what is included in the <em>body</em> with what is included
in the <em>mind</em>. But as he does not admit that the mind is
an existence, as there is nothing but a passing group of
feelings and ideas, not a person who perceives feelings and
has ideas, he speaks of <em>what is given in consciousness</em>, consciousness
being nothing but that passing group, an ever-changing
series, never the same, and never laid hold of and
appropriated by a conscious subject. We do, indeed, call
these ever-changing states of consciousness mind, but this
is a misnomer, if we mean it in the sense of a being.
What is to be considered, therefore, when the analysis
seeks to ascertain the real and only <em>ego</em>, is the body and its
functions, and the passing group of feelings and ideas
which is given in consciousness.</p>

<p>Let us pass on: The body is the physical structure
and its functions. It is pervaded by the forces which its
functions liberate from the latent condition in which they
exist in food and other environment. This physical structure,
thus pervaded by certain forces, is the substantial <em>ego</em>
which lies behind and determines the ever-changing states
of consciousness which we call mind. There is no other
<em>ego</em> than the body. It is phenomenally known to us under
its <em>statical</em> form as the organism; that is to say, when the
body is contemplated as an organism which is not acting,
or as a mere structure. But it is phenomenally known to
us also under its <em>dynamical</em> form, which is when the energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
derived from the pervading forces is diffusing itself through
the organism. Statical,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> I understand, refers to a body at
rest, or in equilibrium, not acting; dynamical refers to
bodies in motion, or acted on by force, in movement. The
human body is phenomenally known to us in both of these
conditions or states. When it is in the dynamical state,
that is, when it is acted on by external stimuli, there will
be nervous changes; these nervous changes have correlative
mental states, which depend partly on the nervous
structure and partly on the amount of the diffused energy
which pervades the organism. But these two factors, the
nervous changes and the diffused energy, are each determined
by causes that are not in consciousness, but beneath
consciousness. This I understand to mean that when there
are nervous changes from a state of rest or non-action, produced
by external stimuli, and a certain amount of diffused
energy pervades the organism, there will be correlative
mental states, which are determined by factors that are not
in consciousness but beneath consciousness. Consciousness,
therefore, is not a perception by a conscious subject,
or a consciousness of a self experienced by a being, but it
is a passing group of feelings and ideas, which have no cohesion,
are never the same, but are ever-changing successions
of impressions produced in the physical organism.</p>

<p>I come now to the summary and conclusion of the
whole matter as expressed in the last sentence of the paragraph
which I have read. There is a mental I, but it is
not a person, an existence, an independent <em>ego</em>. It is constituted
of an aggregate of feelings and ideas, which have
not in themselves a principle of cohesion that holds them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
together as a whole. They are merely passing groups of
feelings and ideas which are never the same, but which
succeed one another without connection or cohesion.
There is an I which continually survives as the subject
of these changing states, but it is that portion of the Unknowable
Power which is statically conditioned in special
nervous structures pervaded by a dynamically conditioned
portion of the Unknowable Power called energy.</p>

<p>So that each individual of the human race is to be contemplated,
not as a dual existence, composed of a body and
a mind, united for a certain period, but as a subject which
is continuously undergoing certain physical changes by the
action through it of a portion of the energy exerted by the
Unknowable Power. The Unknowable Power pulsates
through my bodily organism a certain portion of its
energy, and that of which continuous existence can alone
be predicated is this portion of the Unknowable Power
which is statically conditioned in my nervous structure,
pervaded by a dynamically conditioned portion of that Unknown
Power.</p>

<p>I trust, now, it will not be said that I misrepresent Mr.
Spencer when I assert that he ignores, denies, and endeavors
to disprove the existence of the mind of man as a
spiritual entity, capable of surviving his body. Have you
any fault to find with my paraphrase of the passage on
which I have commented?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> You have paraphrased that passage fairly
enough, but you ought to attend to the proof which he
adduces in support of his position in the subsequent passage
to which he refers you in the one that you have
quoted. Let me read it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>§ 469. And now, before closing the chapter, let me parenthetically
remark on a striking parallelism between the conception of the Object
thus built up, and that which we shall find to be the proper
conception of the Subject. For just in the same way that the Ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>ject
is the unknown permanent <em>nexus</em> which is never itself a phenomenon,
but is that which holds phenomena together; so is the
Subject the unknown permanent <em>nexus</em> which is never itself a state
of consciousness, but which holds states of consciousness together.
Limiting himself to self-analysis, the Subject can never learn anything
about this <em>nexus</em>, further than that it forms part of the <em>nexus</em>
to that peculiar vivid aggregate he distinguishes as his body. If,
however, he makes a vicarious examination, the facts of nervous
structure and function, as exhibited in other bodies like his own,
enable him to see how, for each changing cluster of ideas, there exists
a permanent <em>nexus</em> which, in a sense, corresponds to the permanent
<em>nexus</em> holding together the changing cluster of appearances
referable to the external body.</p>

<p>For, as shown in earlier parts of this work, an idea is the psychical
side of what on its physical side is an involved set of molecular
changes propagated through an involved set of nervous plexuses.
That which makes possible this idea is the pre-existence of these
plexuses, so organized that a wave of molecular motion diffused
through them will produce, as its psychical correlative, the components
of the conception, in due order and degree. This idea lasts
while the waves of molecular motion last, ceasing when they cease;
but that which remains is the set of plexuses. These constitute
the potentiality of the idea, and make possible future ideas like it.
Each such set of plexuses, perpetually modified in detail by perpetual
new actions; capable of entering into countless combinations
with others, just as the objects thought of entered into countless
combinations; and capable of having its several parts variously excited,
just as the external object presents its combined attributes in
various ways&mdash;is thus the permanent internal <em>nexus</em> for ideas, answering
to the permanent external <em>nexus</em> for phenomena. And
just as the external <em>nexus</em> is that which continues to exist amid
transitory appearances, so the internal <em>nexus</em> is that which continues
to exist amid transitory ideas. The ideas have no more a continued
existence than we have found the impressions to have. They are
like the successive chords and cadences brought out from a piano,
which successively die away as other ones are sounded. And it
would be as proper to say that these passing chords and cadences
thereafter exist in the piano, as it is proper to say that passing ideas
thereafter exist in the brain. In the one case, as in the other, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
actual existence is the structure which, under like conditions, again
evolves like combinations.</p>

<p>It is true that we seem to have somewhere within us these sets of
faint states answering to sets of vivid states which once occurred.
It is true that in common life ideas are spoken of as being treasured
up, forming a store of knowledge; the implied notion being that
they are duly arranged and, as it were, pigeon-holed for future use.
It is true that in psychological explanations, ideas are often referred
to as thus having a continued existence. It is true that our forms
of expression are such as to make this implication unavoidable;
and that in many places throughout this work the phrases used apparently
countenance it; though, I believe, they are always transformable
into their scientific equivalents, as above expressed. But
here, as in metaphysical discussions at large, where our express object
is to make a final analysis, and to disentangle facts from hypotheses,
it behooves us to recognize the truth that this popular conception,
habitually adopted into psychological and metaphysical discussions,
is not simply gratuitous, but absolutely at variance with
experience. All which introspection shows us is that under certain
conditions there occurs a state of consciousness more or less like
that which previously occurred under more or less like conditions.
Not only are we without proof that during the interval this state of
consciousness existed under some form; but, so far as observation
reaches, it gives positive evidence to the contrary. For the new state
is never the same&mdash;is never more than an approximate likeness of
that which went before. It has not that identity of structure
which it would have were it a pre-existing thing presenting itself
afresh. Nay, more; even during its presence its identity of structure
is not preserved&mdash;it is not literally the same for two seconds together.
No idea, even of the most familiar object, preserves its
stability while in consciousness. To carry further the foregoing
simile, its temporary existence is like that of a continuously-sounded
chord, of which the components severally vary from instant to instant
in pitch and loudness. Quite apart, however, from any interpretation
of ideas as not substantive things but psychical changes,
corresponding to physical changes wrought in a physical structure,
it suffices to insist upon the obvious truth that the existence in the
Subject of any other ideas than those which are passing, is pure
hypothesis absolutely without any evidence whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<p>And here we come upon yet another phase of that contradiction
which the anti-realistic conception everywhere presents. For setting
out from the data embodied in the popular speech, which asserts
both the continued existence of ideas and the continued existence
of objects, it accepts the fiction as a fact, and on the strength
of it tries to show that the fact is a fiction. Continued existence
being claimed for that which has it not, is thereupon denied to that
which has it.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> The writings of Mr. Spencer, more than
those of any other person of equal reputation that I have
met with, require close examination in order to test the
soundness of his propositions and assertions. Such a passage
as the one which you have now quoted appears, on a
first reading, to be quite plausible. When it is read carefully
two or three times, and analyzed, it is found to be
untenable in its reasoning, and largely made up of dogmatic
assumptions. I shall now give you my reasons for this
criticism. In the first place, let us go through the passage
and fix the meanings of words. "Nexus," although not a
term adopted into the English language, means, I presume,
bond or ligament. "Plexus" is a word that we find in
English dictionaries as a scientific term, and it means a
union of vessels, nerves, or fibers, in the form of net-work.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Taking along these meanings, we find that the subject, the
only thing of which a subjective existence can be predicated,
is the ligament which holds states of consciousness
together, and this permanent ligament is unknown. It is
not itself a state of consciousness, but it is the bond which
holds states of consciousness together. These states of consciousness
are the ideas which are passing in the subject,
which are never the same, which are not a permanent possession,
and therefore there is in the subject no other existence
than the passing ideas of the moment. Ideas, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
are not substantive things, but psychical changes, corresponding
to physical changes wrought in a physical structure.
The proof which is supposed to make this a tenable
hypothesis consists of, first, what can be learned by self-analysis,
or by my introspection of myself; next by vicarious
examination, or by observing the facts of nervous structure
and function exhibited in other bodies like my own. These
examinations enable us to discover, what? Not a conscious
person, learning, appropriating, and holding ideas, but that
there exists only, for each changing cluster of ideas, a permanent
<em>nexus</em>, corresponding to the permanent <em>nexus</em> which
holds together the changing cluster of appearances referable
to the external body. We next have the assertion that
ideas have no more a continued existence than the impressions
made in the external body. Both are transitory, and
in both the only continued existence is the <em>nexus</em>, or ligament
which binds together the changing impressions and
the changing clusters of ideas. This Mr. Spencer illustrates
by the successive chords and cadences brought out
from a piano. These have no existence in the piano, which
is nothing but a mechanical structure, giving forth sounds,
when they are struck, which sounds are merely passing
chords and cadences; and he concludes that it would be
just as proper to say that the passing chords and cadences,
after they have died away, exist in the piano, as it is to
say that passing ideas, after the nervous impressions have
ceased, exist in the brain. Let us now go back and examine
this kind of psychology in detail. Mr. Spencer speaks
of self-analysis, and of the analysis of other minds and
bodies like our own. He uses the terms self, others, me,
mine, him, his. Who or what is this thing which examines
himself or another? Who and what are "you" or "I,"
who sit here talking to each other? Are these mere forms
of expression, always transformable into their scientific
equivalents? What is the scientific equivalent for he, his,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
me, mine, you, yours? Mr. Spencer says that, under certain
conditions, there occurs a state of consciousness more
or less like other states of consciousness that have existed
before, but that the only permanent thing is the <em>nexus</em>
which holds these states of consciousness together. His
illustration of the piano fails. If the piano were a structure
that could of its own volition give forth such sounds as
it chose to utter, it might be correct to speak of it as an
existence having a store of sounds which it could make
reach our ears when and as it saw fit. But it does not
happen to be an automatic machine. It is a mere collection
of strings, of different sizes and tensions, which, when
struck by an instrument called a hammer, cause certain
vibrations in the air. But a human being is an automatic
organism; one that can at pleasure give utterance to ideas
through the vocal organs, so that they are communicated
to you. When I give utterance to an idea, through my
vocal organs, in speaking to you, do I draw on a stock of
permanent ideas, some of which I express, or do I express
nothing but a passing state of consciousness, more or less
like other states of consciousness that have before passed
through my nervous organization? Mr. Spencer asserts
that the notion of the continued existence of ideas is absolutely
at variance with experience. On the contrary, experience
proves it every moment of our lives.</p>

<p>For example: Years ago a person related to me a fact
very interesting and important to me, but I have not until
now had occasion to make use of it. I have a perfect recollection
of what he told me. It bears no resemblance to any
other fact of which I ever heard. It concerns me alone.
I have a perfect recollection of it. I stored it up for future
use whenever I should need to use it. Is it a self-delusion
that I have stored up and treasured this information?
When I recollect and repeat it, just as it was told me, am
I doing nothing but giving expression to a passing idea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
more or less like the original idea? This would be a rather
dangerous doctrine to adopt as the interpretation of experience.
Human testimony respecting things that we have
been told, or have seen, would be a pretty uncertain reliance
if the memory had no other power than to assimilate
a passing idea, more or less, to a former state of consciousness
which more or less resembled the present consciousness.
Men deviate from the truth rather frequently, now; but,
teach them that memory is nothing but the assimilation,
more or less, of a passing idea to some other idea that formerly
passed through their heads, and I should be rather
afraid of their testimony. I should fear that the "psychological
changes" would be a little too frequent, and that the
story would not have "that identity of structure which it
would have were it a pre-existing thing presenting itself
afresh."</p>

<p>What is all the learning of the scholar? Has he treasured
up nothing? Has he nothing in the pigeon-holes of
his mind? Has he no mind in which to store his acquisitions?
Is the sole actual existence "the structure which,
under like conditions, again evolves like combinations"?
Must he find himself under like conditions which will again
evolve like combinations of ideas in passing trains of consciousness,
before he can bring forth from the store-house
of his mind the pre-existing thing that lies within it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> I must here interject a question in my turn.
What is the proof that ideas have a continued existence?
Speaking of the brain as the nerve-center, in which impressions
are produced by molecular changes transmitted along
the nerve-fibers, what proof is there that an idea which is
now passing through the brain continues to exist there, any
more than the passing chord or cadence continues to exist
in the piano?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> Do you not see that the very power of discrimination
which we possess, whereby we distinguish be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>tween
present and former conditions, and present and former
combinations, proves that there is a permanent existing
thing in an idea which presents itself afresh, and with
which we compare the passing idea, so as to determine
whether they are the same? If we did not possess this
power, all thinking, all expression of ideas, all memory, all
that part of consciousness which is not made up of mere
bodily feelings and sensations, would be nothing but the
repetition of the passing idea; and all learning, information,
knowledge, and experience, would be utterly useless.
If there did not exist something with which to compare the
passing idea of the present moment, we should be always
floating on the surface of the passing idea. There would
be no continuity in our intellectual existence. We should
be reduced to the condition of the piano, and could only
give forth such chords and cadences as are produced by
successive blows of the hammer upon the strings of the instrument.
And how could anything originate in ourselves?
What is the faculty which produces ideas that are not only
new to ourselves, not only not suggested by passing ideas,
but new to all other human intellects, and never embraced
in their experience until we put them within their apprehension?
What did Dante do when he produced the "Inferno"?
or Milton, when he composed the "Paradise Lost"?
or Shakespeare, when he composed his "Hamlet"? or
Goethe, when he produced his "Faust"? Does the poet,
when he gives us ideas that we never possessed before, originate
nothing? If he is a maker, a creator, in the realm of
ideas, are those original ideas, which neither he nor any
one else ever had before, the mere result of like combinations
evolved out of like conditions, when neither the old
conditions nor the combinations have anything to do with
the new ideas which he has produced? Surely, in reference
to the great productions of human genius, we must contemplate
the mind as an existence, having the power to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
something more than to produce the transitory ideas that
are passing through the brain from the impressions on
it, communicated through the nervous structure. Surely
there is some other structure than that which can be
likened to the piano. Surely there is something more than
a set of plexuses "which constitute the potentiality of an
idea, and make possible future ideas like it"; for there are
possible future ideas which are not like any former ideas,
which do not depend on any set of plexuses, and do not
cease to be possible when the waves of molecular motion
cease. These possible future ideas are the conceptions
which the mind originates in itself; which are unlike anything
that has gone before, or that is passing now. So that
there are two kinds of ideas: the kind that has a continued
existence, and that consists in knowledge, and is drawn
upon by memory; and the other, the kind of which continued
existence is not to be predicated until it has been
formulated by the faculty of original production, not produced
by an exercise of memory, but produced by original
creation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Has not Mr. Spencer allowed for and accounted
for all that you claim as the power of originating
new ideas? Does he not say that "each set of plexuses"&mdash;each
set of the net-work of ideas&mdash;is "perpetually modified
in detail by perpetual new actions"; is "capable of entering
into countless combinations with others, just as the
objects thought of entered into countless combinations;
and capable of having its several parts variously excited,
just as the external object presents its combined attributes
in various ways"? Is not this the whole matter, in regard
to what you call the power of originating new ideas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> No, it is not. In the first place, I do not
believe that he was here intentionally speaking of any ideas
but those which are suggested by, or involve external objects.
But, if he did mean to include the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
new and original ideas through the countless combinations
into which old ones may be made to enter, his theory does
not fit the case of poetical invention of new ideas, or the
invention of imaginary characters, or lives; for these are
creations which are not mere combinations of old ideas, and
the more they depart from everything suggested by, or resembling,
former ideas, the more we are obliged to recognize
as a faculty of the mind the power to originate and
formulate new ideas that did not previously exist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmicos.</span> Well, you have criticised Mr. Spencer's
mental philosophy from your point of view. Now let me
hear your hypothesis of the origin and nature of mind, with
which you promised to contrast his psychology, and which
you think is better supported.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus.</span> I think I had better put my views in writing,
and read them to you at our next meeting. You can
then have them before you to examine at your leisure. Let
me say in advance, however, that I shall not rely on any of
the metaphysicians, but shall endeavor to give you my conception
of the nature of mind from my own reflections, and
from common experience. I shall make my examination
of the nature of mind precede any suggestion of its probable
origin, just as I think we should examine the structure of
any organism before we undertake to deduce its probable
origin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, then, closes the debate between these two persons,
from whom, at the end of the next chapter, I shall part
with a reluctance which I hope the reader will share. Not
for victory do I allow Sophereus to explain his analysis of
mind, without describing how his scientific friend receives
it.</p>

<p class="intro">Sophereus discourses on the Nature and Origin of the Human Mind.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sophereus</span>, in fulfillment of his intention expressed at
their last meeting, reads to the scientist the following</p>


<p class="center">DISCOURSE ON THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE HUMAN
MIND.</p>

<p>I regard the mind as an organism, capable of anatomical
examination, as the body is, but of course by very different
means. In the anatomical examination of an animal
organism we use our eye-sight to acquire a knowledge of its
component parts, its organs, and its structure, by dissection
of a dead or inspection of a living subject. But, in
studying the anatomy of mind, we have a subject that is
beyond our visual perception. It is not, however, beyond
our examination. We carry on that examination by means
of the introspection which consciousness enables us to have
of our own minds, and by observing and comparing the
phenomena of mind as manifested in other persons. If
these respective means of investigation enable us to reach
the conviction that in each individual of the human race
there is an existence of a spiritual nature and another existence
of a corporeal or physical nature, we shall have attained
this conclusion by observing the difference between
the two organisms. The fact that we can not detect the
bond that unites them while they are united should not
lead us to doubt their distinct existence as organisms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
different natures, but made for a temporary period to act
on and with each other.</p>

<p>Before entering further into the subject, I will refer to
some of the terms which we are obliged to use in speaking
of the nature of mind as an organism, when contrasted
with the nature of the physical organism. We speak, for
example, and from the want of another term we are obliged
to speak, of the substance of mind. But, while we thus
speak of mind in a term of matter, there is no implication
that the subject of which we speak is of the same nature as
that which constitutes the physical organism; nor is there
any danger of the incorporation of materialistic ideas with
our ideas of the fabric of mind. On the contrary, the very
nature of the inquiry is whether that which constitutes
mind is something different from that which constitutes
body; and, although in speaking of both we use the term
substance, we mean in the one case organized matter, and
in the other case organized spirit. There is a very notable
instance of a corresponding use of terms in the passage of
one of St. Paul's epistles, where he discourses on the doctrine
of the resurrection. According to my universal custom
when I refer to any of the writings regarded by the
Christian world as sacred, or inspired, I lay aside altogether
the idea of a person speaking by divine or any other authority.
I cite the statement of St. Paul, in its philosophical
aspect, as an instance of the use of the term body
applied to each of the distinct organisms. His statement,
or assertion, or assumption&mdash;call it what you please&mdash;is, "If
there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body";<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
he uses the term <em>body</em> in speaking of that which is natural,
or of the earth, earthy, and of that which is spiritual, or
heavenly. Without following him into the nature of the
occurrence which he affirms is to take place in the resurrection,
the question is whether he was or was not philosophi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>cally
correct, in speaking of two kinds of organisms, one
composed of matter, and liable to corruption and dissolution,
and the other composed of spirit, indestructible and
imperishable.</p>

<p>In order to be understood, he was obliged to use the
term <em>body</em> in reference to both of these organisms, just as
we are obliged to use the term <em>substance</em> when we speak of
the subject of contemplation as a physical or as a spiritual
organism. Can this distinctness of nature be predicated of
the body and the mind of man before what we call death?</p>

<p>The peculiar occurrence which St. Paul so vigorously
and vividly describes as what is to happen at the resurrection,
is a prophecy in which he mingles with great force
philosophical illustrations and the information which he
claims to have received from inspiration; or things revealed
to him by the Almighty through the Holy Spirit. He
expresses himself in terms level to the apprehension of
those whom he is addressing; and in this use of terms he
does just what we do when we speak of a natural body and
a spiritual body. He puts the existence of the natural
body hypothetically:</p>

<p>"<em>If</em> there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual
body."<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Paraphrased as the whole passage may be, he
says, "You well know that there is a natural body, and I
tell you that there is also a spiritual body." Laying aside
the mode in which the spiritual body is to be manifested at
and after the resurrection, we have to consider whether,
during this life, there is a bodily organism and a mental
organism, distinct in their natures, but united for a time
by a bond which is hidden from our detection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<p>I have used the term anatomy of the mind, from the
same necessity which compels me to speak of the substance
of mind. You will understand that, when I speak of anatomical
examination of the mind, I mean that analysis
of its structure which we can make by the use of the appropriate
means, and which enables us to conceive that it
is an organized structure of a peculiar character.</p>

<p>The grand difficulty with Mr. Spencer's "Psychology"
is, that after he has made what he calls "the proximate
components of mind" to consist of "two broadly contrasted
kinds&mdash;feelings and the relations between feelings," which
are mere impressions produced on the nerve-center by
molecular changes in the fluid or semi-fluid substance of
the nerves, he has not approached to a solution of the question
whether there is or is not a something to which these
feelings and the relations between them suggest ideas, and
which holds ideas continuously for future use.</p>

<p>Thus he makes consciousness to consist in passing
groups of feelings and their relations, and not in a conscious
subject. He denies that there is any <em>ego</em>, in the sense in
which every person is conscious of a self, and maintains that
the only substantive existence is the unknown ligament
which holds together the ever-changing states of feelings
and impressions produced in the nerve-center. There is a
far better method of investigation. It is to inquire into the
fabric of the mind as an organism, by determining whether
mental phenomena justify us in the conclusion that it is an
organism. In this way we may reach a satisfactory conclusion
that the mind is a substantive existence, possessing
a uniform structure, of a character, however, fundamentally
different from the bodily structure; and in this way we
may be able to explain, wholly or in part, how the mind
and the body act on and with each other so long as the
connection is maintained.</p>

<p>I am entirely free to acknowledge that, when I speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
of the substance of mind, or speak of it as an organism, I
am and must remain ignorant of the nature of its substance
beyond the point where its self-manifestations cease. But
the question is, whether we are not under an irresistible
necessity of adopting as a postulate the existence of a something
which has certain inherent powers, and whether the
mental phenomena, the self-manifestations of those powers,
do not necessarily lead us to the conception and conviction
that mind is a substantive existence. I can not talk or
think of consciousness apart from a conscious subject, or
of feelings without a subject that feels. A thread of consciousness,
or a series of feelings, conveys no meaning to
me, apart from a being who has the consciousness and perceives
the feelings.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>One very important question to be considered in all such
investigations is, Whether our experience does not teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
us that we are mentally so constituted that certain conceptions
are necessary to us? Our mental nature is placed
under certain laws, as our physical or corporeal nature is
placed under certain other laws. One of these necessary
conceptions, which are imposed on us, as it seems to me,
by a law of our mental constitution, is a conception of the
fundamental difference between matter and spirit. In what
way is it forced upon us that there is a natural world and
a spiritual world? The phenomena of matter and the phenomena
of mind are essentially different. In ourselves they
occur in conjunction, and they occur in disjunction. They
are manifested synchronously, and they are manifested
separately in point of time. The normal action of all the
functions of the body is not necessary to the action of the
mind. The body may be prostrated by disease, and the
moment of its death may be at hand; yet the mind, to the
last moment of the physical life, may be unclouded, and
its manifestations may be as perfect as they ever were in the
full health and activity of the vital functions of the body.
No one who stands at a death-bed where this phenomenon
occurs, and observes how completely the mind is master of
itself; how it holds in consciousness the past and the present;
how it essays to grasp the future for those whom it
is to leave and for itself, can easily escape the conviction
that death is nothing but the dissolution of the bond which
has hitherto held together the two existences that constituted
the human being, one of which is to be dissolved into
its elemental and material substances, and the other of
which is to go elsewhere, intact and indestructible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me now refer to what is taking place while I am
writing this essay. I have said that the phenomena of our
bodily organism and the phenomena of our mental organism
may occur synchronously in the same individual. The
act of writing an original composition is an instance of this.
The action of certain organs of the body and the action of
the mind are simultaneous. In time, they can not be separated.
In themselves, they are separable and separate.
The thought springing up in the mind may be retained
there, or may flow into language and be written by the hand
upon the page. No one can detect in himself any instant
of time when the mental formation of a sentence, or any
clause of a sentence, as he writes, is separable from the
physical act of writing. In that not very common, but still
possible, feat of dictating to two amanuenses, at what appears
to be the same time, on two distinct subjects, there
is undoubtedly an appreciable interval, in which the mind
passes from one subject to the other, and then back again,
with great rapidity. But, when one is one's own amanuensis,
when the act of thinking and formulating the
thought, and the act of writing it down in words, is performed
by the same person, there is a simultaneous action
of that which originates the thought and clothes it in words,
and the act of the bodily organ which inscribes the words
upon paper. How is this phenomenon to be explained?
And to what does it lead? Is there anything in the whole
range of Mr. Spencer's "Psychology" that will interpret
this familiar experience? May it not be interpreted by
an anatomical examination of the mind as an organism?</p>

<p>I do not now refer to cases where a thought is completely
formulated before the pen begins to be moved over the
paper, and is then recalled by an effort of the memory and
written down. I am referring to what I suppose is the
habit of many persons in writing, namely, the origination
and formulation of the thought as the hand moves the pen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
a habit of which most practiced writers are perfectly conscious.
The same thing occurs in what is truly called extemporaneous
speaking,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> when oral discourse is not a mere
repetition, <i lang="la">memoriter</i>, of thoughts and sentences which had
been previously formulated, but, as the word extemporaneous
implies, when the thought and the language flow from
the vocal organs <i lang="la">eo instanti</i> with their conception. In
these and the similar cases of improvisation and animated
conversation, in which there is a synchronous action of the
mind and the bodily organs, it would be impossible for us
to have that action if mind were constituted as Mr. Spencer
supposes it to be. If there were no mind in the sense of
an organized entity, conceiving a thought and clothing it
in the language needful to give it written or oral expression,
"if the <em>ego</em> were nothing more than the passing group of
feelings and ideas"&mdash;if an "idea lasts (only) while the
nerves of molecular motion last, ceasing when they cease"&mdash;if
that which remains is (only) the "set of plexuses"&mdash;how
could we originate any new thought? The very illustration
to which Mr. Spencer resorts, when he likens the
automatic human being to the non-automatic piano, and
makes them analogous in their action, in order to show
that passing ideas do not have a continual existence in the
mind, but that the actual existence is the physical structure
which, under like conditions, again evolves like combinations,
reduces us at once to the level of the piano, and
precludes the potentiality of a new and original idea which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
is not a combination of former ideas, and is produced under
different conditions. The assertion or argument that each
set of plexuses is capable of entering into countless combinations
with others, and so renders possible future ideas,
does not advance us one step to the solution of what takes
place when we conceive a new thought, clothe it in language,
and write it down on paper, or give it oral expression.</p>

<p>In justification of this criticism, let me now refer to that
intellectual process which is called "invention," in its application
to the mechanic arts. I do not mean to suggest
or to claim that this kind of invention is an act which is
to be referred to a distinct and peculiar faculty of certain
minds, in the possession of which one man may differ from
another. But I shall endeavor to describe what takes place
when one conceives the intellectual plan of a certain new
combination of mechanical devices, and embodies that plan
in a machine which differs from all other previous machines
in its characteristic method of operation. For convenience,
I shall speak of the person who produces such a machine
as the inventor, which is the same as speaking of him as
the maker, as the poet is the maker of a poem. This act
of invention, or the making of some concrete new thing, is
an act of creation. The inventor, then, may be supposed
to have learned all that empirical and all that scientific
mechanics could teach him; to have had any quantity of
passing groups of ideas pass through his consciousness; to
be possessed of any number of plexuses capable of entering
into countless combinations with others. These plexuses, or
networks of transitory ideas, consisting of former impressions
in the nerve-center, must, it is said, be recalled under
the like conditions which produced them. But the conditions
for the inventor are not the same. Something is to be
produced into which the old ideas do not enter. There is
to be a new arrangement of old mechanical devices; a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
combination is to be made, which will possess a method of
operation and accomplish a result never before seen or obtained.
A new concrete thing, a new machine, is to be
created. That the conception must be formed, that the
objective point, to which the whole intellectual effort is to
aim, must be seen, is manifest. A tentative intellectual
process may have to be gone through before the full conception
is reached, just as a tentative experimental process
may be necessary in finding out how the practical embodiment
of the conception is to be reached in building the
structure. These processes may go on simultaneously or
separately; but, when they are both completed, when the
new machine stands before us, we see at once that the plan
is an intellectual conception, perfectly original, and the
physical structure is a new arrangement of matter effected
by the hand of the inventor or by the hands of others,
which he uses as his instruments in doing the physical
work. I do not know, therefore, how this phenomenon is
to be explained upon the theory that the only <em>ego</em> is the
body and its functions, which lies behind and determines
ever-changing states of consciousness. I know not how else
to interpret the phenomenon of invention, excepting to
adopt the postulate that there is a mind, a substantive existence,
which, while its consciousness holds ideas suggested
by former conditions, has the inherent power to originate
ideas that did not form a part of any previous state of consciousness.</p>

<p>I have spoken of mind as an organism and as a substantive
existence. This is a deduction to be drawn from the
manifestations of mental phenomena. In order to guard
against an objection that may possibly be interposed in the
way of this method of investigation, I will anticipate and
answer it. It will be said that we can not define or describe
the substance of mind; can not tell whether it is a unit, in
itself, or an aggregate of units; we know and can know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
nothing more than its approximate components, and all
that we know of these does not justify us in assuming to
speak of the substance of mind. I have more than once
suggested, in our former conferences, that our inability to
define and to describe the substance of any supposed existence
is no proper objection to the hypothesis that there
is such an existence. When we undertake to define matter,
or to describe the substance of that which we call matter,
we find that we soon reach a point where precise definition
or description ceases. Yet we do not for that reason
refrain from deducing the existence of matter from the
manifestations of certain phenomena and from our experience
with them. It is perfectly true that we know matter
only by the manifestations of certain physical phenomena;
that we can not define the nature of its substance. All we
can do, by the most minute analysis, is to arrive at the perception
of the ultimate particles or units of matter; and the
nature of the substance of which these units are composed is
incapable of any further description. "Matter"<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> is one of
the words in the English language which are used in a great
variety of senses, exact and inexact, literal and figurative.
In its philosophical sense, meaning the substance of which
all physical bodies are composed, the efforts of lexicographers
to give a definition, descriptive of the nature of what is defined,
show that definition is, strictly speaking, impossible.
All that can be said is that matter is "substance extended";
or that which is visible or tangible, as "earth, wood, stone,
air, vapor, water"; or "the substance of which all bodies
are composed." But these efforts at definition express
only what is needful to be expressed in contrasting matter
with that other existence which is called "spirit." This
is another word which is used in very different senses, but
of which no more exact definition can be given, when it is
used in its philosophical sense, than can be given of "mat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>ter."
Lexicographers have defined "spirit," in one of
its meanings, as "the <em>soul</em> of man; the intelligent, immaterial,
and immortal part of human beings"; and in another
of its meanings, more broadly, as "an immaterial,
intelligent substance." In these definitions they have followed
the metaphysicians, and the uses of the word in the
English translation of the Bible. When we turn to the
definition of "soul," we find it given as "the spiritual and
immortal substance in man, which distinguishes him from
brutes; that part of man which enables him to think and
reason, and which renders him a subject of moral government."
We also have it defined as "the understanding,
the intellectual principle." Undoubtedly these definitions
involve certain assumptions, such as the existence of a substance
called spirit, and the existence of an intellectual
principle, of which "soul," "spirit," and "intellect" are
mere names. But there is no difficulty in the way of our
knowing what is meant when these terms are used. The
difficulty of giving a definition without a circuitous use of
terms, explaining the one by the other, and then explaining
the last by the first, does not prevent us from having
a definite conception of the thing spoken of. When we
speak of mind, soul, or intellect, what we think of is the
something in ourselves of which we are conscious, and
whose manifestations we observe in other beings like ourselves;
and what we have to do is to examine the evidence
which may bring home to our convictions the existence of
this something that perceives, thinks, acts, originates new
ideas; holds former ideas in consciousness, is connected
with and acts upon and is acted on by bodily organs, and
is at the same time more than and different from those organs.</p>

<p>I have referred to some of the mental phenomena which
have the strongest tendency to prove the existence of the
mind as an organized entity. These are the phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
which occur in our waking hours, when the intellectual
faculties and the bodily organs are in the full exercise of
their normal functions respectively. There is another
class of mental phenomena which may be said to be abnormal,
in this, that the intellectual faculties and the bodily
organs do not preserve the same relations to each other
in all respects that they do when we are fully awake.
These are the phenomena that occur during sleep&mdash;a class
of mental phenomena of great consequence to be observed
and analyzed in any study of psychology. They are of an
extraordinary variety, complex in the highest degree, and
dependent on numerous causes of mental and physical disturbance;
but it is quite possible to extract from some of
them certain definite conclusions.</p>

<p>Sleep, properly regarded, when it is perfect, is a state
of absolute rest and inactivity of all the organs and functions
of the body save the digestion of food and the circulation
of the blood, and of all the mental faculties. Perfect
sleep, sleep in which there is absolutely no consciousness,
is more rare than those states in which there is more
or less consciousness. But it is often an actual state of
both body and mind, and it was evidently designed to renew
the vigor of both, and to prevent the wear and tear of
unbroken activity. Between absolute unconsciousness induced
by perfect sleep and the full consciousness of our
waking moments, there are many intermediate states; and
the phenomena of these intermediate states present very
strong proofs of the existence of the mind as a special
and spiritual entity, capable in greater or less degree of
acting without the aid of the physical organs. I do not except
even the organ of the brain from this suspension of
action during certain states when the mind is in more or
less of activity; for I am convinced that in some of the
mental phenomena to which I shall advert and which I
shall endeavor to describe, the brain is in a state of perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
sleep, and that in the production of those phenomena it
takes no part. In other mental phenomena, which occur
during sleep, the brain or some part of it is evidently
acted upon by the mind, as in the somnambulistic condition,
when the nerves of motion, responding to the action
of the mind, communicate action to the muscles, and the
body walks about and performs other external acts.</p>

<p>There are other mental phenomena occurring during
very profound sleep of the body and its organs, when the
mind does not appear to derive its action from the brain,
or to be dependent on the brain for its activity; when it
is exceedingly active, and when it communicates action to
none of the bodily organs; when, for example, it carries on
long trains of thought, composes sentences, invents conversations,
makes poetry and prose, and performs other
intellectual processes. Distributed into classes, the most
important mental phenomena occurring during sleep are
the following:</p>

<p>First, and presenting perhaps the strongest proof of the
mind's independence of all the bodily organs, is that whole
class of mental phenomena in which, during profound
sleep of the body, we carry on conversations, compose original
matter in the form of oral or written discourse, which
we seem to ourselves to be producing, and solve intellectual
difficulties which have baffled us when awake, or imagine
that we receive from an unexpected source important information
that we are not conscious of having previously
received.</p>

<p>The phenomena of conversations, to which we appear
to ourselves to be listening during sleep, or in which we appear
to ourselves to be taking part, are, when analyzed, most
remarkable occurrences, for it is the mind of the sleeper
which originates the whole of what appears to be said by
different persons. These conversations are as vivid, as
much marked by different intellectual and personal charac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>teristics,
sudden and unexpected turns, apt repartee, interchange
of ideas between two or more persons, as are the
real conversations which we overhear, or in which we take
part, when we are awake. Yet the whole of what is said,
or appears to us to be said, is the invention of the one mind,
which appears to itself to be listening to or talking with
other minds, and all the while the body is wrapped in profound
sleep. This extraordinary intellectual feat, so familiar
to us that it scarcely attracts our attention unless we undertake
to analyze it, is closely akin to the action of the mind
when the body and the mind are neither of them asleep, and
when we invent a conversation between different persons.
But this occurrence is marked by another extraordinary peculiarity:
for it happens, during sleep, to persons who could
not, when awake, invent and write such conversations at
will, and who in their waking hours have very little of the
imaginative faculty needed for such productions. I account
for this phenomenon by the hypothesis that when the
mind is free from the necessity of depending on the bodily
organs for its action, as it is during profound sleep of the
body, when its normal relations with the body are completely
suspended and it is left to its independent action, it
has a power of separate action. This, I think, accounts for
a kind of mental action which, when compared with that
which occurs in conjunction with the action of the bodily
organs, may be called abnormal. Under the impulse of its
own unrestrained and uncorrected activity, the mind goes
through processes of invention, the products of which are
sometimes wild and incoherent, sometimes exceedingly coherent,
sensible, and apt. Let the person to whom this
occurs be thoroughly awakened out of one of these states,
and the mind becomes immediately again subjected to the
necessity of acting along with, and under the conditions of
its normal relations to the body.</p>

<p>Akin to this mental feat of inventing conversations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
during a sleep of the body, is the power of composing, during
such sleep, oral discourse of one's own, or the power of
composing something which we appear to ourselves to be
writing. I suppose this is an occurrence which happens to
most persons who are much accustomed to writing or to
public speaking. It is often an involuntary action of the
mind; that is to say, it is sometimes accompanied with a
distinct consciousness that it is a process that ought to be
arrested because it is a dangerous one, and yet it can not
be arrested before full waking consciousness returns. On
goes the flow of thought and language, apparently with
great success; we seem to be speaking or writing with even
more than our usual power, and all the while in the style
that belongs to us; but, until we are fully restored to the
normal relation of the mind and the body, we can not at will
arrest this independent action of the mind, but must wait
until our bodily senses are again in full activity. I do not
suppose that this phenomenon ought to be explained by the
hypothesis that there are certain parts or organs of the
brain which are specially concerned in the work of original
composition of intellectual matter, and that these organs
are not affected by the sleep that is prevailing in other
parts of the brain. While it is doubtless true that there
are special systems of nerves which proceed from or conduct
to special parts of the brain, and by which action is
imparted to or received from the other organs of the body,
and while some of these special parts of the brain may be
in the state of absolute inactivity called sleep, and others
are not, I know of no warrant for the hypothesis that the
intellectual operations or processes are dependent upon any
particular organ or organs of the brain, as distinguished
from those from and to which proceed special systems of
nerves. If any person, who is much accustomed to that
kind of intellectual activity which consists in original
composition of intellectual matter, will attend to his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
consciousness, and probe it as far as he may, he will not
find reason, I apprehend, to conclude that the power of
thought and of clothing thought in language resides in any
special part of the brain. His experience and introspection
will be more likely to lead him to the conclusion that this
power, whether it is exerted when he is asleep or awake
bodily, is a power that inheres in the mind itself regarded
as a spiritual existence and organism, and that the action
of the brain, or of any part of it, is necessary to the exercise
of this power only when it is necessary, as it is in our waking
moments, to use some of the bodily organs in order to
give the thought oral or written expression by giving it
utterance through the vocal organs or by writing it down
on paper. Certain it is that we conceive thoughts in more
or less of connected sequence, and clothe them intellectually
in language of which we have entire consciousness while
the process is going on, without the action of any part of
the body.</p>

<p>It may be objected to this view that the intellectual
products which we seem to ourselves to be making when
we are asleep would, if they could be repeated by an effort
of the memory, word for word, just as they seem to have
occurred, be found to be of the same incoherent, senseless
stuff of which all dreams are made; and that this test
would show that the brain is at such times not absolutely
and completely in the condition which is called sleep, but
that it is only partially in that condition; that it is performing
its function feebly, imperfectly, and not as it performs
that function when the whole body is awake. In
reference to this hypothesis, I will repeat an anecdote which
I have somewhere read, which is equally valuable whether
it was an imaginary or a real occurrence.</p>

<p>A gentleman of literary pursuits, who was a very respectable
poet, was subject to this habit of composition
during sleep. One night he awoke his wife and informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
her that he had composed in his dream some of the best
and most original verses that he had ever written. He
begged her at once to get a candle, pen, ink, and paper,
and let him dictate to her the new composition that appeared
to him so striking. When they read together the
new poem on the next morning, it turned out to be nonsensically
puerile. But occurrences of this kind, if they
could be multiplied, would prove only that we are liable to
illusions in sleep, in regard to the comparative merits of
our intellectual products, which we imagine ourselves to be
creating when we are in that state, as we are in regard to
other things. We are under a delusion when we imagine
in our dreams that we encounter and converse with another
person, living or dead. We are perhaps deluding ourselves
when in sleep we compose or seem to compose an original
poem. But what is it that deludes itself, either in respect
to the interview with another person, or in respect to the
new composition? Is it the brain, or is it the mind? Is
it a person, or a bodily organ that has the false impression,
in the one case or the other? There must be a something
that is subject to an illusion, before there can be an illusion.
If both brain and mind are in profound sleep, absolute suspension
of all action, there can be no illusion about anything.
If the brain is absolutely asleep and the mind is
not, the illusion is in the mind and not in the brain. That
the latter is what often occurs, the experience of the illiterate
and uncultivated makes them aware, as well as the
experience of the lettered scholar and the practiced writer.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Under the same head, I will now refer to those strange
but familiar occurrences which take place when there come
to us, in sleep, solutions of difficulties which we had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
overcome by all our efforts while awake, and which appeared
to us utterly dark when we lay down to rest. These mental
phenomena are almost innumerably various. They take
place in regard to all kinds of subjects, to lines of conduct
and action, to everything about which our thoughts are employed;
and they are a class of phenomena within everybody's
experience. There is scarcely any one to whom it
has not happened to lie down at night with a mind distressed
and perplexed about some problem that requires a
definite solution, and to rise in the morning, usually after
a night of undisturbed rest, with his mind perfectly clear
on the subject, and with just the solution that did not
come to him when he devoted to it all his waking thoughts.
What is the explanation of this phenomenon? If the mind
is an independent entity, a spiritual organism, capable of
its own action without the aid of the body under certain
circumstances, this phenomenon can be explained. If the
mind is not a spiritual organism, capable, under any circumstances,
of acting without the aid of the bodily organs,
this phenomenon can not be explained.</p>

<p>The most probable explanation is this: When we are
awake, and devote our thoughts to a particular subject that
is attended with great difficulties, we go over the same
ground repeatedly&mdash;the mind travels and toils in the same
ruts. Nothing new occurs, because we look at the subject
in the same way every time we think of it. We are liable
to be kept in the same beaten path by the associations between
our thoughts and the bodily states in which we have
those thoughts&mdash;associations which are exceedingly powerful.
But let these associations be dissolved as they are
during perfect sleep&mdash;let the mind be in a condition to act
without being dependent on the brain or any other bodily
organ for aid, or exposed to be hampered by the conditions
of the body, and there will be a mental activity in
which ideas will be wrought out that did not occur to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
while we were awake. The memory, too, may recall a fact
which we had learned while awake, and yet we may be unable
to recollect how it came to our knowledge. At such
times, the fact is recalled; but as the mind is acting in a
condition which is abnormal when compared with the waking
condition, and is liable to delusions about some things,
we imagine that the fact is revealed to us in some wild and
supernatural way, as by a person who is dead and who has
come to us to communicate it. There is a well-authenticated
account of an occurrence of this kind, given by Sir
Walter Scott in one of the notes to his "Antiquary," and
on which he founds an incident related by one of the personages
in his story. The real occurrence was this: A gentleman
in Scotland was involved in a litigation about a
claim asserted upon his landed estate. He had a strong
conviction that his father had bargained and paid for a release
of the claim, but he could find no such paper. Without
it he was sure to be defeated in the suit. Distressed by
this prospect, but utterly unable to see any way out of his
misfortune, he lay down to sleep, on the night before he
was to go into Edinburgh to attend the trial of the cause.
He dreamed that his father appeared to him, and told him
that the claim had been released, and that the paper was in
the hands of a lawyer in a neighboring town, whose name
the paternal shade mentioned.</p>

<p>Before going into Edinburgh on the next day, the gentleman
rode to the place which his father had indicated, and
found the lawyer, of whose name he had been previously
unconscious. This person turned out to be an old man,
who had forgotten the fact that he had transacted this
piece of business for the gentleman's father; but on being
told of the fact that his client had paid his fee in a foreign
coin of a peculiar character&mdash;which was one part of the
story which the father's apparition related to the son&mdash;he
recalled the whole of the circumstances, searched for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
paper, and found it. The gentleman's estate was saved to
him; but he became very superstitious about dreams, and
suffered much from that cause, as was quite natural. Sir
Walter's solution of the whole affair is of course the correct
one: "The dream was only the recapitulation of information
which Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; had really received from his father
while in life, but which at first he merely recalled as a general
impression that the claim was settled. It is not uncommon
for persons to recover, during sleep, the thread of
ideas which they have lost during their waking hours."<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
Sir Walter makes another observation which is worthy of
being repeated&mdash;that in dreams men are not surprised by
apparitions. Why are we not? Because the mind is in a
state of abnormal activity, in which everything that occurs
to it seems perfectly natural. The delusion in regard to
the mode in which the very important fact was communicated
to Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; in his dream, was substituted in the
place of the actual communication made to him by his
father during life. The latter he had wholly forgotten,
and he had forgotten the circumstance of payment of the
lawyer's fee in a peculiar coin, which had also been mentioned
to him by his father when living. This remarkable
incident, which might doubtless be paralleled by many similar
occurrences, proves one of two things: either that the
exercise of the memory is wholly dependent upon a waking
condition of the brain, or that there may be an abnormal
and imperfect act of memory while the brain is in profound
sleep, in the course of which a fact becomes mixed with a
delusion about the mode in which we are told of the fact.
What happened to Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; was that his mind recalled
the fact, but imagined that he then learned it for the first
time from an apparition. I do not know how such a phenomenon
can be explained, excepting by the hypothesis that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
the mind is a special existence, which acts during sleep of
the body upon facts that are lodged in the memory, but
mixes them with imaginary and delusive appearances, so
that the mode in which the fact was actually learned is obliterated
from the memory, and some supernatural mode of
communication takes its place. On the return of waking
consciousness, the mode in which the fact was actually
learned is still shut out from recollection, and, if the person
to whom this kind of delusion has occurred is of a superstitious
turn, he will act on what he has imagined was told
him by the apparition, because he has no other means of
rescuing himself from an evil.</p>

<p>In regard to the mental phenomena which occur without
delusions or apparitions, where the thoughts on a difficult
subject become clearer and more satisfactory to us
when we awake from sleep than they ever were during our
waking hours, I suppose the explanation is this: During
profound sleep of the body, including the brain, there is
an entire suspension of every bodily function excepting
the digestion of food and the circulation of the blood. If
there is excited in some of the other organs an action of
a peculiar kind, by an excitation of the nerves connected
with those organs, it is proof that the condition of perfect
sleep is not prevailing in all parts of the brain. The state
to which I now refer supposes a complete inactivity of the
whole bodily organism save in the digestive function and
the circulation of the blood. In such a state, the mind,
that which thinks and reasons, does not act upon the brain,
and is not acted upon by it. It is capable of thinking on
any subject which has employed its thoughts during the
waking hours; and while, in some cases, it is visited by apparitions
and subject to delusions, it is in other cases engaged
in ideas that involve no delusive appearances. Freed
from all the associations of these ideas with the feelings prevailing
in the body when we think of the subject during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
our waking hours, we are able to perceive relations of the
subject which have not before occurred to us. When we
pass from the condition of sleep to the full consciousness
of our bodily and mental organism, we are intellectually
possessed of these new relations of the subject, which we
have brought with us out of the state in which we acquired
them, and they furnish us with new materials for the solution
of the problem that we had not solved when we lay
down to rest. It is not, I am persuaded, because the mind
was at rest during sleep, and when we become awake is by
reason of that rest better able to grapple with the difficulties
of the subject, that we do grapple with them successfully;
for in the case supposed, which is a very common
experience, the thoughts are actually employed on the subject,
while the body and the brain are in the absolute rest
and inactivity of all the organic functions excepting those
of digestion and circulation of the blood. I do not know
that it is possible to detect, in a person sleeping, an increased
circulation of the blood to any part of the brain
which may be supposed to be concerned in the act of thinking,
and at the same time to know that thinking is going
on, unless such an observation could be made of a person
in the state called somnambulism, which is not the state of
which I am now speaking. But reasoning upon the phenomenon
which I have now described, according to all that
we can learn from our own experience or from observation
of others, I reach the conclusion that the mind, the thinking
and reasoning entity, can and does, in profound sleep
of the body and the brain, employ itself upon a subject that
has occupied us when awake, and can perceive new relations
of that subject, which had not before occurred to us,
without the activity of any portion of the nerve-center
which is called the brain. Does this hypothesis assume
that our thoughts when asleep are more valuable than our
waking thoughts? It does, to a certain extent and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
certain circumstances, for experience proves that in sleep
we acquire ideas which we did not have before we fell
asleep, and which we bring with us out of that condition.</p>

<p>That I have now given the true explanation of this familiar
experience will appear, I think, from this consideration:
There are very few nights when we do not in sleep
have many thoughts. The states of perfect unconsciousness
are comparatively rare. If the brain were never
entirely asleep, if it were always engaged in the physical
work of thinking&mdash;whatever that work may be&mdash;it would
be worn out prematurely. But if the brain is perfectly at
rest, while the mind is actively employed, the brain undergoes
no strain and suffers no exhaustion; and the mind
suffers no strain or exhaustion because it is in its nature
incapable of wear and tear. It is only when the mind acts
on the brain that exhaustion takes place. I speak now of
what happens in states of ordinarily good health.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>I shall now refer to some of the very peculiar phenomena
of somnambulism; and in illustration of their various
phases I shall resort to Shakespeare's picture of the sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>-walking
of Lady Macbeth, which, although purely imaginary,
is a most accurate exhibition of nature. Treating it,
as we are entitled to treat it, as if it were a real occurrence
at which we ourselves were witnesses, with a knowledge of
her character and history, an analysis of the situation in
which she was placed when the habit of somnambulism
came upon her, and of the mode in which her mind acted
upon her body, will enable us to see the phenomena in
their true philosophical aspect. We may suppose ourselves
present, with the doctor and the gentlewoman of her bedchamber,
when she comes forth in her night-dress and with
a candle in her hand, and we witness the impressive scene
of a disturbed mind overmastering the body while the body
is asleep. It seems that, after the murder of Duncan, when
she imbrued her own hands with his blood in smearing the
faces of his sleeping grooms, the habit of sleep-walking had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
come over her. As we stand by the side of the awe-stricken
witnesses, and hear their whispered conversation,
we get the first description of her actions since the new
king, Macbeth, her husband, whom she had instigated to
murder the old king, went into the field. These first actions
of hers, as described by the gentlewoman to the doctor,
do not necessarily exhibit the working of a guilty conscience.
They exhibit a mind oppressed and disturbed by
cares of business and of state; and they are a distinct class
of the phenomena of somnambulism. The gentlewoman
tells the doctor that "since his Majesty went into the field,
I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown
upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write
upon it, read it, afterward seal it, and again return to bed;
yet all this while in a most fast sleep." This is merely a
description of what the witness has seen, and it might occur
to any person of strong intellectual faculties, disturbed
by great cares, without the action of a guilty conscience. It
makes the situation real when the doctor recognizes the fact
of this "great perturbation in nature! to receive at once
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching." As
they are whispering together, the doctor trying to make the
gentlewoman tell him what at such times she has heard her
say, which the loyal servant refuses to tell, Lady Macbeth
moves forward, with the taper in her hand.</p>

<p>Here we may pause upon the first exhibition of the
phenomenon called sleep-walking, which we get by description
only, and analyze the nature of the action. It is perfectly
apparent that what the poet accepted as true, is the
power of the mind to move the body while the body is
asleep, so as to make it perform many acts. Experience
makes this assumption perfectly correct. I presume it
will not be questioned that this phenomenon is described
by Shakespeare with entire accuracy, and it is explicable
only upon the hypothesis that the mind has some control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
over the body while the body is asleep. Actions as minute
and as much premeditated as those performed by Lady
Macbeth "in a most fast sleep," have been witnessed in
persons who were undoubtedly asleep, and whose eyes were
open for some purposes, but, as in her case, their sense was
shut for other purposes.</p>

<p>We now pass to the more awful exhibition of a mind
worked upon by a guilty conscience. Lady Macbeth comes
out of her bedroom fast asleep, but with a light in her
hand. The gentlewoman who interprets her state to the
doctor informs him that she has a light by her bedside continuously;
and we thus learn that her nights are so disturbed
that she can not bear darkness. They notice that
her eyes are open, but "their sense is shut." Then begin
the terrific manifestations of the control of a guilty conscience
over both mind and body, when the memory, alive
to certain terrible facts, plays fantastic tricks with itself,
and mingles delusions with realities. As she approaches,
with the taper in her hand, she performs an action which
the gentlewoman says she has repeatedly seen her go
through, for a quarter of an hour at a time, endeavoring to
rub a spot of blood off from one of her hands. Her hands
have been clean, physically, since the time when she first
washed them on the fatal night; but the delusion that is
upon her is that there is blood on them still. She goes on
rubbing them, and her first exclamation is, "Out, damned
spot! out, I say!" Yet it will not out. That little hand
wears what she imagines to be an indelible stain. After
her first exclamation, the memory rushes back to the moment
before the murder. She thinks she hears, perhaps
does hear, the clock strike&mdash;"one, two"; and then, as if
speaking to her husband, she says, "Why, then 'tis time to
do't." Then there is a pause, and out comes the reflection,
"Hell is murky!" This seems to indicate that darkness,
in which she and her husband are whispering together just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
before the murder, is a hell, and so very fit for what is
about to be done. Hell is murky, as this chamber is.
Then she remembers her husband's reluctance, and fancying
that she is still talking with him and bracing him up
to the deed, she says: "Fye, my lord, fye! a soldier, and
afeard? What need we <em>fear</em> who knows it, when none can
call our <em>power</em> to account?" Presently she is looking back
upon the deed, and exclaims, "Yet who would have
thought the old man to have had so much blood in him!"
Then she recurs to herself as if she were another: "The
thane of Fife had a wife; where is <em>she</em> now?" Again
she thinks of her stained hands: "What, will these hands
<em>ne'er</em> be clean?" Are they to wear this horrible stain forever?
Instantly she is again at the door of Duncan's
chamber, speaking to her husband: "No more o' that, my
lord, no more o' that: you mar all with this starting!"
Then her hands again, her poor hands; they <em>smell</em> of the
blood: "Here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes
of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand! Oh, oh,
oh!" Then, after another pause, she is speaking to her husband,
when the deed has been done: "Wash your hands,
put on your night-gown; look not so pale!" In another
instant she is thinking of Banquo's murder, which occurred
after Duncan's, and she says to her husband: "I tell you
yet again, Banquo's <em>buried</em>; he can not come out of his
<em>grave</em>!" Once more she is back at the door of Duncan's
chamber, in the darkness, and the murder has been committed.
Speaking to her husband, she says: "To bed, to
bed; there's knocking at the gate. Come, come, come,
come, give me your hand. What's done can not be undone.
To bed, to bed, to bed!" Then she goes quickly toward
her chamber and to bed, believing that Macbeth is with her
and that she is holding his hand.</p>

<p>How mixed, how wild, how fantastic, how coherent and
incoherent are these phantoms of the imagination! If she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
were awake, things would not thus present themselves to
her. Every event in the dreadful story would stand in its
true relations, and, however she might be suffering the
pangs of a guilty conscience, she would not mix up the
scenes through which she had passed, but every fact would
stand in its due order. She would be conscious that there
was no blood upon her hands, and that they did not need
the perfumes of Arabia to sweeten them. She would know
that Duncan had been murdered, and would not enact the
murder over again. She would remember that Banquo's
murder had not been distinctly made known to her, and
that she had only surmised it, when at the banquet Macbeth
fancied that the ghost of Banquo rose and sat at the table&mdash;an
apparition which neither she nor any one else saw.
But, in that strange scene, it flashed across her mind that
Banquo was dead, and to herself she interpreted truly what
was passing in her husband's mind, and instantly explained
his conduct to the company as the recurrence of an old
malady to which he was subject.</p>

<p>If we go back to what had actually happened before the
banquet, and then go forward to the condition in which
she is seen by the doctor and her attendant, we shall understand
how her mind was working, not upon a fact that
she knew, but upon a fact which she had truly surmised.
In her somnambulistic state, she says to her husband: "<em>I tell
you yet again</em>, Banquo's buried; he can not come out of
his grave." Had she said this to him before? According
to the course of the story, as the text of the play gives it
to us, she had not. In the second scene of the third act,
where, after Duncan had been murdered and Macbeth had
become king, they are preparing for the banquet, to which
Banquo was expected as one of the guests, Macbeth and his
wife are talking together, and she is trying to get him out
of the contemplative and conscience-stricken mood in
which he looks back upon what they have done. He con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>cludes
one of his mixed and melancholy reflections with
these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">Duncan is in his grave;</div>
<div class="verse">After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;</div>
<div class="verse">Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,</div>
<div class="verse">Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing</div>
<div class="verse">Can touch him further!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then she says to him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2"><i>Lady Macbeth.</i> Come on;</div>
<div class="verse">Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;</div>
<div class="verse">Be bright and jovial 'mong your guests to-night.</div>
<div class="verse indent2"><i>Macbeth.</i> So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you;</div>
<div class="verse">Let your remembrance apply to <i>Banquo</i>;</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Present him eminence</em>,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> <em>both with eye and tongue</em>:</div>

<div class="verse">Must lave our honors in these flattering streams;</div>
<div class="verse">And make our faces vizards to our hearts,</div>
<div class="verse">Disguising what they are.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Just at this moment, therefore, he is not thinking of
killing Banquo, but wishes him to be received with all
honor. But, in answer to his last reflection on the hypocritical
part that they must act, she says to him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">You must leave this.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then bursts forth the terrific oppression of his soul:</p>

<p>She affects not to understand him&mdash;perhaps does not&mdash;and
she asks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>In the next scene, the murderers, previously engaged
by Macbeth, waylay Banquo in the park as he is approaching
the castle, and kill him, his son Fleance and a servant
escaping. Then follows the banquet, Macbeth himself
moving about at first, and then he takes a seat at the table
lower down. One of the murderers comes in and whispers
to him what has been done. The stage direction is, "The
ghost of Banquo rises and sits in Macbeth's place." As no
one at the table but Macbeth sees this apparition, it might
be inferred that it is the force of his imagination which
presents the spectacle to him, as Lady Macbeth supposes,
when she says to him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">O proper stuff!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the very painting of your fear:</div>
<div class="verse">This is the air-drawn dagger, which, you said,</div>
<div class="verse">Led you to Duncan.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the stage direction must be taken as a literal ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>pearance
of the ghost, so as to make it visible to the audience,
while it is invisible to all at the table excepting Macbeth
himself.</p>

<p>If, now, we go forward to the night when Lady Macbeth
is walking in her sleep, and remember what had occurred
previous to and at the banquet, we see how, without any
actual previous knowledge that her husband intended to
have Banquo killed, and with only the surmise that he had
been killed, which comes to her at the banquet, she came
to say to her husband, in her dream:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he can not come out of his grave.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here we have a fact lodged in the mind during the
waking hours, and in sleep wrought into a strange mixture
with the killing of Duncan, with which it had in reality
no connection, having transpired afterward. This is very
strong proof of the capacity of the mind to act during sleep
without the action of the brain. The mind of the guilty
sleep-walker is filled with horrible memories, which it can
not shut out, but with which it can not deal in their actual
order and true relations, because the sequences of thought,
during sleep, are abnormal. Those whose experience has
never involved any such workings of conscience are perfectly
aware of the fact that in dreams ideas that are separately
lodged in the consciousness become entangled with
each other in the most fantastic manner. Lady Macbeth
at one moment even thinks of herself as if she were some
one else, and asks, Where is the woman now who was the
wife of the thane of Fife? Every one has experienced in
sleep the same projection of one's self out of one's own
consciousness; so that we seem to be contemplating ourselves
as if we were a different person.</p>

<p>The phenomena that occur during the delirium of fever,
where the normal consciousness is lost for the time being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
are in some respects analogous to and in some respects different
from those which occur during the somnambulistic
condition. Delirium occurs when the body and the brain
are not in the condition of sleep; but the senses of perception
convey false impressions to the mind, and the mind
itself has temporarily lost its power of correcting its own
action by its former experience. The nearest friends who
are around the bedside are not recognized by the sufferer;
they appear to be strangers, and the patient talks to them
as if both they and he were not their real selves. It would
seem that we can safely infer from the state of delirium a
suspension of the direct and normal connection between
the brain and the mind; that neither of them can act, in relation
to the other, as they both act when there is no such
disturbance: but that this condition, so far from proving
or tending to prove that the mind is not an independent
spiritual existence, has a strong tendency to prove that it
is. Insanity, on the other hand, is probably a derangement
of the mental organism akin to derangement of the
physical organism, but not necessarily connected with or
induced by the latter, for the bodily health of the insane is
often entirely sound while the mind is in an entirely unsound
and irrational condition. But the phenomena of insanity
are too various and multiform, and too much dependent
on both physical and moral causes, to afford any satisfactory
proofs of the postulate which I propound in this essay.
The safest line of investigation is that which I suggested in
the first instance, namely, to regard the mind as an organism,
and to ascertain whether it is susceptible of anatomical
examination in a sense analogous to anatomical examination
of the bodily organism. All that I have hitherto said is
useful by way of preliminary illustration of my main hypothesis.
It has a strong tendency to show that the mind,
instead of consisting, as some philosophers now suppose, of
the products of a material organism, is itself an organized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
being with a definite structure and capable of living a life
of its own, although at present dwelling in a corporeal organism
which affects it in various ways while the connection
lasts. The theory that all mental phenomena are
products of our corporeal organism is one that appears to
derive great support from examinations of the structure of
the brain and of the whole nervous system. The physical
anatomy of man exhibits very striking illustrations of the
influence of corporeal changes upon the mental state, as the
mental changes show corresponding influences upon the corporeal
state. But, then, there are undoubtedly phenomena
that are purely and exclusively mental; and therefore when
we undertake to solve these mental phenomena by the materialistic
hypothesis we find a sense of inadequate causation
confronting us so directly that we are compelled to
look for a solution elsewhere. It is certain that things
take place in the inner recesses of our minds, in the production
of which the bodily senses not only render no aid,
but in which they have no part whatever. It is necessary,
therefore, to carry our investigations into a class of mental
phenomena in which all physical causation ceases to afford
an adequate guide to a conclusion.</p>

<p>It will not be denied that the products of material organisms
can be proved to consist of matter and of nothing
else. Their presence can be detected by some physical
test. For example, if it be true that all animals have been
evolved from protoplasm, the organisms are simply changes
in the form of a certain portion of matter. If, in an individual
organism having a highly developed nervous structure,
there are actions produced by an excitation of the
nerves of sensation, those actions are simply molecular
changes in the matter comprising the sensitive and easily
moved substance of the nerve-fibers. However far and into
whatever minutiæ we carry our investigations into organized
matter, we find that its products remain material, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
they consist only of changes in the material substance of a
material organization. But, when we pass from such material
products into the domain of purely mental phenomena, are
we warranted in saying that, although the latter are not,
properly speaking, <em>products</em> of the material organization,
they are <em>effects</em> corresponding to and dependent upon the
excitation of the nerves of sensation? This last hypothesis
must assume one of two things: either that there is a distinction
between those corporeal feelings which do not and
those which do produce mental changes or mental effects,
or, if there are corporeal feelings which produce corresponding
mental states and mental action, there must be a
something on which the effects can be wrought, and this
something must be an independent organism. It is doubtless
true that there are many corporeal feelings which are
followed by no very important mental effects, especially
during a sound state of bodily health. But it is equally
true that, if there are corporeal feelings which influence our
mental action, there must be an organism which is capable
of being so influenced; and our experience and consciousness
teach us that there is such a difference between corporeal
feelings and mental phenomena that the probability
of a difference in the originating causes becomes very great.
We know that the mind can and does act with great force
when bodily suffering is extreme; that it has an energy of
its own which enables it to rise above all the power of physical
pain to restrain or influence it. I must therefore follow
out, as I had originally projected, my anatomical
analysis of the mind as an independent spiritual organism.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a correct conclusion concerning
the structure of mind, we must first observe that there are
four special corporeal organs by which the capability of the
mind to receive impressions from matter is acted upon. It
is through these means that the properties of matter, or
those properties which can make themselves known to us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
become known to us. The senses, as they are usually
called, are sight, hearing, smell, and taste. The external
organ of each of these senses is furnished with a set of
nerves, the function of which is to transmit from that organ
a wave of molecular motion along the fluid or semi-fluid
substance inclosed in the nerve-tubes to the great
nerve-center the brain, the central recipient of all such
motions. Such, at least, is the theory, which may be accepted
as a fact. But, then, the question remains, What
is the intellectual perception or mental cognition of the
idea suggested by one of these supposed transmissions of a
wave of molecular motion? Is there a being, a person, a
spiritual entity, conceiving the idea or having an intellectual
perception of it? Or is there no such being, and
while we attribute to the office of the nervous system the
function of producing certain feelings or sensations in the
brain, do these sensations or feelings constitute all that
there is of consciousness?</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to conceive of consciousness as
anything but an intuitive sense of his own existence, experienced
by a being capable of such an experience, because
endowed with such a faculty. It is certain that when we
so regard consciousness we are not deceiving ourselves; for
if any one will consider what would happen to him if he
should lose this faculty of being sensible of his own existence,
he will see that in the event of that loss he could
neither distinguish himself from other persons, nor have
any control over his own actions, or any cognition whatever.
For this reason, the theory on which I made some
criticisms in one of our late conversations is the one with
which I contrast my conception of mind. If that theory
fails to satisfy a reflecting person in regard to the nature
of consciousness, as certified to him by his own experience,
the hypothesis that the mind is an extended and organized
being, of which a conception can be formed, and not an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
unextended and unorganized something of which no conception
can be formed, must be accepted as the alternative.</p>

<p>I explained in our former discussion my understanding
of Mr. Spencer's theory of the only <em>ego</em> that can be scientifically
recognized; and, in order to encounter it by my
own hypothesis, I will here restate its substantial position
in a condensed form.</p>

<p>By the <em>ego</em> of which he treats, I understand him to
mean all that we can arrive at by an analysis of what takes
place in the body and its functions, and of "what is given
in consciousness." This phrase&mdash;"what is given in consciousness"&mdash;reveals
to us his purpose to reduce consciousness
from a self-conviction and cognition of one's own
existence to a mere passing group of feelings, which constitute
"the ever-changing states of consciousness" that
we "<em>call</em> mind." So that, when we speak of mind, we
mean and can mean nothing more than certain states of
feeling produced in our brains by perpetually changing impressions.
We do not and can not mean that there is
a person who perceives and holds ideas suggested by external
objects through the action of his nervous system.
All that we know about any <em>ego</em>, any mental I, is that there
is a physical structure, pervaded by certain physical forces,
that produce "consecutive states," which Mr. Spencer calls
"mental <em>states</em>"; and the aggregate of the feelings and ideas
which thus constitute the <em>mental states</em> is the only <em>ego</em> of
which any continued existence can be predicated. But even
these aggregates of feelings and ideas have, according to
this philosopher, no principle of cohesion holding them together
as a whole; and, therefore, all that we can assume as
having any continuously surviving and durable existence is
the changing <em>states</em> produced by the action through us of a
certain unknowable power, statically conditioned in our
nervous organism, which is pervaded by a dynamically con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>ditioned
portion of that unknowable power which is operating
everywhere in nature, and is called "energy."<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>So far as this theory is based upon the existence of a
physical organism, whose functions liberate from the food
supplied to it certain forces, which are distributed by the
activities of the organism, we may accept it as a statement
of what actually takes place in the form of physical phenomena.
But when we follow the physical phenomena of
the diffused energy into its action upon the brain, by the
transmission of an impulse, we must stop with the effect of
that impulse upon a corporeal organ, or we must go further
and find a something which receives into itself and appropriates
to itself the idea the elements of which the impulse
has transmitted. The presence of that something in ourselves
may be illustrated by its absence from a mechanism in
which we know that it does not exist, but which appears
superficially to be animated by an intelligent principle possessing
volition. We stand, for example, before one of those
automatic machines which perform actions that seem to be
guided by a living spirit. They are mere physical organisms,
constructed without the principle of life that inhabits
animal organisms, but they are so admirably contrived
for the production of certain limited but complex movements
that they suggest the presence of a spiritual being acting
as we ourselves act. But the least reflection upon what
we see makes us aware that there is nothing before us but
a mechanical organism, in which the artisan who made it
has availed himself of certain forces of nature and properties
of matter, whereby he uses a portion of the energy that
pervades the universe. There is nothing within the machine
to which this energy communicates ideas that are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
be the subject of its future voluntary operation. All is
comprehended in a fixed mechanical operation of certain
machinery, and, when we have analyzed and understood the
physical phenomena, we can follow them no further, because
there is no translation of the physical energy into
mental phenomena. But in ourselves there is such a
translation, and we must follow it into the mental phenomena.
So following it, we find ourselves in the presence
of a something which has a self-conscious individuality,
and which, by a mysterious bond of connection, is so
united with a physical organism that it is capable of receiving,
appropriating, and preserving the ideas which the
physical organism was designed to produce in it.</p>

<p>My objection to Mr. Spencer's system of psychology
may be summed up in what I shall now say upon his chief
position, which is that "an idea is the psychical side of
what, on its physical side, is an involved set of molecular
changes, propagated through an involved set of nervous
plexuses." Translated into what I take to be his meaning,
the assertion, or hypothesis, is this: An idea is the mental
cognition of an external object, as, for example, a tree.
When we are looking at or thinking of a tree, we have a
mental cognition of a tree; and this idea of a tree is said
to be the psychical side of that which on its physical side
has been transmitted to our brain by molecular changes
through our visual nerves. The idea of the tree is the
psychical correlative of a wave of molecular motion diffused
through our organs of vision; and the conception of
a tree thus becomes a possible conception. But why did
not the learned philosopher follow the wave of molecular
motion until he found the impression of the object which
the visual organs have transmitted to the brain, or the
nerve-center, translated into a thought by an intelligent
being, capable, by its own organization, of having that
thought? Why does he speak of an idea as the psychical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
side of what, on its physical side, is one and the same
thing? Obviously, because he meant to ignore the psychical
or mental existence as an independent existence, or as any
existence at all. Now, there is no way in which the psychical
side and the physical side can be bridged over, excepting
by the hypothesis that the mind is an entity of
a peculiar nature, different in structure from the bodily
organism, but capable, by the connection between them,
of receiving and transmuting into thought the impressions
which the waves of molecular motion transmit to the brain
from the external object. To say that the set of plexuses,
or networks, which hold together the waves of molecular
motion, constitute the potentiality of the idea and make
possible future ideas like it, explains nothing. The potentiality
of the idea, or the possibility of ideas like it, depends
upon the existence of a something which is capable
of conceiving the idea, holding it, and reproducing it
to itself, after the waves of molecular motion cease. I call
this a process of translation, or transmutation, because
there is no other convenient term for it. It is a process
analogous to the physical assimilation of food by the organs
of physical digestion, with this difference, however,
that the action of the mental organism in the assimilation
of ideas is the action of a spiritual and intellectual organism
upon materials that are brought within its reach by the
means of communication with the external world afforded
by the physical senses and the nervous system. The image
of the tree produced upon the retina of the eye by the lines
of light that proceed from every point of that object is the
food which the mind assimilates and transmutes into the
idea of the tree; and this may remain as a permanent
mental perception or cognition, although the object itself
may have been seen but once. If seen many times, the
various aspects in which it has been seen are transmuted
into so many distinct ideas. If many kinds of trees, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
different shapes and dimensions, have been seen, the varieties
become a part of our consciousness in the several degrees
of their precise resemblances and differences which
we happen to have observed, when the different impressions
were produced upon the retina. Can there be any doubt
that this is the process by which the infant begins to acquire
ideas of external objects, and that, as adolescence goes
on and the powers of sense expand with the growth and
exercise of the physical organs, there is a corresponding
growth and expansion of the mental powers?</p>

<p>This hypothesis of the progress of mental growth, <i lang="la">paris
passibus</i> with the growth of the physical organism, brings
me to the consideration of one of those specimens of Mr.
Spencer's peculiar logic, in a passage in which he undertakes
to disprove the existence of mind as anything more
than what he calls the psychical side of physical impressions.
He is treating of the impossibility of our "knowing"
anything about the substance of mind; and he propounds
this impossibility in the following logical formula:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>...To know anything is to distinguish it as such or such&mdash;to
class it as of this or that order. An object is said to be but little
known when it is alien to objects of which we have had experience;
and it is said to be well known when there is great community of
attributes between it and objects of which we have had experience.
Hence, by implication, an object is completely known when this
recognized community is complete; and completely unknown when
there is no recognized community at all. Manifestly, then, the
smallest conceivable degree of knowledge implies at least two things
between which some community is recognized. But, if so, how can
we know the substance of mind? To know the substance of mind
is to be conscious of some community between it and some other
substance. If, with the idealist, we say that there exists no other
substance, then, necessarily, as there is nothing with which the
substance of mind can be even compared, much less assimilated, it
remains unknown; while, if we hold with the realist that being
is fundamentally divisible into that which is present to us as mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
and that which, lying outside of it, is not mind, then, as this proposition
itself asserts a difference and not a likeness, it is equally clear
that mind remains unclassable and therefore unknowable.</p></blockquote>

<p>The answer to this supposed insuperable dilemma may
be made by determining what we mean when we speak of
knowing a thing. Definition of knowing is here essential,
and the first inquiry we have to make is whether, in order
to know mind, it is necessary to find and recognize some
community between the substance of mind and some other
substance? The statement is, on the one hand, that there
exists no other substance with which the substance of
mind can be compared, much less assimilated, and therefore
there is no aid to be derived from resemblance; or, on
the other hand, that, if being is fundamentally divisible
into something which is mind and something which is not
mind, we depend for a knowledge of mind on a difference,
and not on a likeness, and we have no means of knowing
that difference. Upon either proposition, mind remains
unclassable and therefore unknowable.</p>

<p>It may be conceded that our knowledge of the properties
and forms of matter consists in recognizing a community
or a difference between things which belong to the
same class, so that there is a comparison between things
which are of the same substance. But what is to prevent
us from classifying the substance of mind, when the fundamental
idea of its substance is that it is something which
resembles no other substance, but constitutes a class or
description of being that stands entirely by itself, and in
which, for a knowledge of its properties we distinguish its
properties from those of any other substance? The only
difficulty that arises here springs from the fact that we
have but one word&mdash;substance&mdash;by which to speak of the
two existences that we call mind and matter; just as we
can only speak of an organism when we speak of the natural
body and the spiritual body. But this use of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
term to express things which in our consciousness stand
fundamentally opposed to each other does not prevent us
from discriminating between the means by which we become
conscious of the two things, or from classifying the
knowledge which we have of mind as something distinct
from the knowledge which we have of matter.</p>

<p>We must discriminate between the means by which the
properties of matter become known to us and the means by
which the properties of mind become known to us. In
both cases there is knowledge, but it is knowledge of a
different kind; it is obtained by different means; and we
must therefore recognize a fundamental difference between
the substance of mind and the substance of matter. It is
true that our knowledge of the properties of matter and
our knowledge of the properties of mind are alike in this,
that in both cases it is knowledge by one and the same person;
but the distinction is that, in the one case, I have
knowledge of objects external to myself, and, in the other
case, I have knowledge of myself as the person possessing
knowledge of external objects. The knowledge that we
have of ourselves is what most persons mean by consciousness,
and it is what we should scientifically understand
by that term, although consciousness is often used as
synonymous with mental cognition of things external to
ourselves, and as cognition of ourselves also.</p>

<p>I shall now quote from the chapter in which Mr. Spencer
makes a special synthesis of reason, and in which he
denies the existence of the commonly assumed <em>hiatus</em> between
reason and instinct, maintaining that the former is
the continuation of the latter, because, as he thinks, the
highest forms of psychical activity arise little by little out
of the lowest and can not be separated from them. The
passage which I shall now analyze is this:</p>

<p>"Here seems to be the fittest place for pointing out
how the general doctrine that has been developed supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
a reconciliation between the experience-hypothesis as commonly
interpreted and the hypothesis which the transcendentalists
oppose to it.</p>

<p>"The universal law, that, other things equal, the cohesion
of psychical states is proportionate to the frequency
with which they have followed one another in experience,
supplies an explanation of the so-called 'forms of thought,'
as soon as it is supplemented by the law that habitual psychical
successions entail some hereditary tendency to such
successions, which, under persistent conditions, will become
cumulative in generation after generation. We saw that
the establishment of those compound reflex actions called
instincts is comprehensible on the principle that inner relations
are, by perpetual repetition, organized into correspondence
with outer relations. We have now to observe
that the establishment of those consolidated, those indissoluble,
those instinctive mental relations constituting our
ideas of space and time, is comprehensible on the same
principle.</p>

<p>"For, if, even to external relations that are often experienced
during the life of a single organism, answering internal
relations are established that become next to automatic&mdash;if
such a combination of psychical changes as that
which guides a savage in hitting a bird with an arrow
becomes, by constant repetition, so organized as to be performed
almost without thought of the processes of adjustment
gone through&mdash;and if skill of this kind is so far transmissible
that particular races of men become characterized
by particular aptitudes, which are nothing else than partially
organized psychical connections; then, if there exist certain
external relations which are experienced by all organisms
at all instants of their waking lives&mdash;relations which are
absolutely constant, absolutely universal&mdash;there will be established
answering internal relations that are absolutely
constant, absolutely universal. Such relations we have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
those of space and time. The organization of subjective
relations adjusted to these objective relations has been cumulative,
not in each race of creatures only, but throughout
successive races of creatures; and such subjective relations
have, therefore, become more consolidated than all others.
Being experienced in every perception and every action of
each creature, these connections among outer existences
must, for this reason, too, be responded to by connections
among inner feelings that are, above all others, indissoluble.
As the substrata of all other relations in the <em>non-ego</em>,
they must be responded to by conceptions that are the substrata
of all other relations in the <em>ego</em>. Being the constant
and infinitely repeated elements of thought, they must become
the automatic elements of thought&mdash;the elements of
thought which it is impossible to get rid of&mdash;the 'forms of
intuition.'</p>

<p>"Such, it seems to me, is the only possible reconciliation
between the experience-hypothesis and the hypothesis of
the transcendentalists, neither of which is tenable by itself.
Insurmountable difficulties are presented by the Kantian
doctrine (as we shall hereafter see); and the antagonist
doctrine, taken alone, presents difficulties that are equally
insurmountable. To rest with the unqualified assertion
that, antecedent to experience, the mind is a blank, is to
ignore the questions: Whence comes the power of organizing
experiences? Whence arise the different degrees of
that power possessed by different races of organisms, and
different individuals of the same race? If, at birth, there
exists nothing but a passive receptivity of impressions, why
is not a horse as educable as a man? Should it be said
that language makes the difference, then why do not the
cat and the dog, reared in the same household, arrive at
equal degrees and kinds of intelligence? Understood in
its current form, the experience-hypothesis implies that
the presence of a definitely organized nervous system is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
circumstance of no moment&mdash;a fact not needing to be taken
into account! Yet it is the all-important fact&mdash;the fact to
which, in one sense, the criticisms of Leibnitz and others
pointed&mdash;the fact without which an assimilation of experiences
is inexplicable.</p>

<p>"Throughout the animal kingdom in general the actions
are dependent on the nervous structure. The physiologist
shows us that each reflex movement implies the agency of
certain nerves and ganglia; that a development of complicated
instincts is accompanied by complication of the nervous
centers and their commissural connections; that the
same creature in different stages, as larva and imago, for
example, changes its instincts as its nervous structure
changes; and that, as we advance to creatures of high intelligence,
a vast increase in the size and in the complexity
of the nervous system takes place. What is the obvious
inference? It is that the ability to co-ordinate impressions
and to perform the appropriate actions always implies the
pre-existence of certain nerves arranged in a certain way.
What is the meaning of the human brain? It is that the
many <em>established</em> relations among its parts stand for so many
<em>established</em> relations among the psychical changes. Each
of the constant connections among the fibers of the cerebral
masses answers to some constant connection of phenomena
in the experiences of the race. Just as the organized arrangement
subsisting between the sensory nerves of the
nostrils and the motor nerves of the respiratory muscles
not only makes possible a sneeze, but also, in the newly
born infant, implies sneezings to be hereafter performed,
so, all the organized arrangements subsisting among the
nerves of the infant's brain not only make possible certain
combinations of impressions, but also imply that such combinations
will hereafter be made, imply that there are answering
combinations in the outer world, imply a preparedness
to cognize these combinations, imply faculties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
comprehending them. It is true that the resulting compound
psychical changes do not take place with the same
readiness and automatic precision as the simple reflex action
instanced; it is true that some individual experiences seem
required to establish them. But, while this is partly due
to the fact that these combinations are highly involved, extremely
varied in their modes of occurrence, made up, therefore,
of psychical relations less completely coherent, and
hence need further repetitions to perfect them, it is in a
much greater degree due to the fact that at birth the organization
of the brain is incomplete, and does not cease
its spontaneous progress for twenty or thirty years afterward.
Those who contend that knowledge results wholly
from the experiences of the individual, ignoring as they do
the mental evolution which accompanies the autogenous
development of the nervous system, fall into an error as
great as if they were to ascribe all bodily growth and structure
to exercise, forgetting the innate tendency to assume
the adult form. Were the infant born with a full-sized and
completely constructed brain, their position would be less
untenable. But, as the case stands, the gradually increasing
intelligence displayed throughout childhood and youth
is more attributable to the completion of the cerebral organization
than to the individual experiences&mdash;a truth
proved by the fact that in adult life there is sometimes displayed
a high endowment of some faculty which, during
education, was never brought into play. Doubtless, experiences
received by the individual furnish the concrete materials
for all thought. Doubtless, the organized and semi-organized
arrangements existing among the cerebral nerves
can give no knowledge until there has been a presentation
of the external relations to which they correspond. And,
doubtless, the child's daily observations and reasonings aid
the formation of those involved nervous connections that
are in process of spontaneous evolution, just as its daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
gambols aid the development of its limbs. But saying this
is quite a different thing from saying that its intelligence is
wholly <em>produced</em> by its experiences. That is an utterly inadmissible
doctrine&mdash;a doctrine which makes the presence
of a brain meaningless&mdash;a doctrine which makes idiocy
unaccountable.</p>

<p>"In the sense, then, that there exist in the nervous system
certain pre-established relations answering to relations
in the environment, there is truth in the doctrine of
'forms of intuition'&mdash;not the truth which its defenders
suppose, but a parallel truth. Corresponding to absolute
external relations, there are established in the structure
of the nervous system absolute internal relations&mdash;relations
that are potentially present before birth in the shape of
definite nervous connections, that are antecedent to, and
independent of, individual experiences, and that are automatically
disclosed along with the first cognitions. And,
as here understood, it is not only these fundamental relations
which are thus predetermined, but also hosts of other
relations of a more or less constant kind, which are congenitally
represented by more or less complete nervous
connections. But these predetermined internal relations,
though independent of the experiences of the individual,
are not independent of experiences in general: they have
been determined by the experiences of preceding organisms.
The corollary here drawn from the general argument is
that the human brain is an organized register of infinitely
numerous experiences received during the evolution of life,
or, rather, during the evolution of that series of organisms
through which the human organism has been reached.
The effects of the most uniform and frequent of these experiences
have been successively bequeathed, principal and
interest; and have slowly amounted to that high intelligence
which lies latent in the brain of the infant&mdash;which
the infant in after-life exercises and perhaps strengthens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
or further complicates, and which, with minute additions,
it bequeaths to future generations; and thus it happens
that the European inherits from twenty to thirty cubic
inches more brain than the Papuan. Thus it happens that
faculties, as of music, which scarcely exist in some inferior
human races, become congenital in superior ones. Thus it
happens that out of savages unable to count up to the
number of their fingers, and speaking a language containing
only nouns and verbs, arise at length our Newtons and
Shakespeares."<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The learned philosopher has here dealt with two hypotheses,
neither of which he considers tenable by itself.
The first is that the individual mind, anterior to experience,
is a blank; that at birth there exists nothing but a
passive receptivity of impressions, which become organized
into intelligence by experience. The other hypothesis is
that of the transcendental school, which attributes the
growth of intelligence wholly to implanted intuitions,
which become expanded by the increase of mental power.
His argument is put thus: If at birth the mind of the individual
is a blank, and it becomes capable of thought or
possessed of intelligence by experience, beginning with a
passive receptivity of impressions, and going on to their
organization into intelligence by the repetition of experiences
and their increasing complexity&mdash;why, he asks, is
not a horse as educable as a man? Why do not the cat
and the dog, reared in the same household and hearing
human beings use language every moment of their lives,
arrive at equal degrees and kinds of intelligence? In the
first place, as a matter of fact, many animals are educable
beyond their natural capacity of intelligence, or beyond the
point at which they would arrive without such education,
to a very remarkable degree. I have heard a credible de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>scription
of a dog which would ascend to a chamber and
bring down an article that he had been told to bring.
Many repetitions of the command and the performance had
taught the animal to associate the name of the article which
he was to bring down with the act which he was to perform.
While I am writing, a bear beneath my window is
going through performances, at the word of command,
of very considerable varieties; actions which he would not
do if he had not been trained to do them. The trained
war-horse knows the meaning of the different airs played
on the bugle upon the battle-field or the parade-ground,
and instantly charges or wheels about, without waiting to
be prompted by the bit or the spur. Insects can be trained,
to some extent, in the same way; birds to a much greater
extent. Is the explanation of these capacities to be found
in a definitely organized nervous system as the all-important
fact without which an assimilation of experiences is
inexplicable? Grant that, as we advance from creatures of
very low to creatures of very high intelligence, we find a
vast increase in the size and complexity of the nervous system
taking place through the series, until we arrive at its
highest and most complex development in man. What is
the hypothesis which explains the difference in mental
power between man and all the other creatures below him
in the capability of co-ordinating impressions and performing
the appropriate actions? It is, according to Mr. Spencer,
that the capability implies the existence of certain
nerves arranged in a certain way; that where this arrangement
does not exist the capability is not found; and where
it exists in only a low degree the capability exists only in the
same degree. As two parallel and concurring facts these
may be conceded. But why are not these facts entirely
consistent with another hypothesis, namely, that to each
creature, along with its specially organized nervous system,
there has been given by divine appointment a certain de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>gree
of innate mental power, to explain which we must
follow the impressions produced in the nervous system into
their transmutation into intelligence, until we arrive at the
limit of that intelligence? Mr. Spencer's answer to this
inquiry is twofold: first, that the experience-hypothesis,
in the case of the individual creature, or the constant repetition
of the impressions and the appropriate actions, is
insufficient to account for what takes place, without recognizing
the fact that the actions are dependent on the nervous
structure, without which the impressions would not be
followed by the actions; second, that the nervous structure
in the different races of animals has come to be what it is in
each race by gradual modifications and increments through
the process of evolution of organisms out of one another,
and that these accumulations have resulted in the human
brain, which has the highest power of co-ordinating the
impressions and performing the appropriate actions. Then
he puts, with an air of final solution, the question, "What
is the human brain?" which he answers in his own way.</p>

<p>His mode of answering this question is that the brain
is an organ with established relations among its parts, which
stand for so many established relations among the psychical
changes. I understand this to mean, that as the human
brain, in the process of animal evolution, has come to have
certain constant connections among the fibers of the cerebral
masses, each of these connections answers to some constant
connection of phenomena in the experiences of the
race. His corollary is that the human brain is an organized
register of infinitely numerous experiences received by the
race during the evolution of life, or during the evolution of
that series of organisms through which the human organism
has been reached. Each infant of the human race, to
whom has descended this improved and perfect brain, has
latent in that organ a high capacity for intelligence. This
it begins to exercise and strengthen and further compli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>cate
as life goes on, and at the end of twenty or thirty years
the individual brain is fully developed, and this development,
or capacity for development, the individual bequeaths
with minute additions, principal and interest, to
future generations. In different races of men the cubic
bulk of the brain varies greatly, according to the size transmitted
from ancestors; and so certain faculties which
scarcely exist in some races become congenital in others; and
whereas the remote ancestors of all of us were savages, incapable
even of conceiving of numbers, and possessing but
the rudest elements of language, there have at length arisen
our Newtons and Shakespeares.</p>

<p>This hypothesis leads me to ask a question and to state
a fact. The question is, What is it in the infant of the
most developed and cultivated race that constitutes the
high intelligence which is said to lie latent in his brain?
In other words, is there nothing in that infant, or in the
adult which he becomes, but a brain and a nervous system
of a highly organized and complex physical structure adapted
to receive impressions on itself from without? Are the experiences
which have been enjoyed by the progenitors of the
human infant or by preceding organisms registered in his
brain, and is his capacity of intelligence dependent on his
having inherited the same or nearly the same volume of
brain as that which was possessed by his progenitors? And
does the intelligence consist, in degree or in kind, in nothing
but a repetition of the same experiences as those
through which his progenitors were carried, or is there a
something in him to which his individual experiences contribute
the mental food by which the mind is nourished
and by the assimilation of which its individual intellectual
growth becomes possible?</p>

<p>It is not necessary to question the fact that individuals
of great intellect, the Newtons and the Shakespeares, have
had or may have had large brains; or the fact that, as be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>tween
races of men, the most intelligent have brains of
greater cubic measure than the less intelligent. But it has
not always been found that individuals of superior intellect
have had comparatively larger brains than other individuals,
nor that those who have had very large brains have
transmitted them to their children. The important fact
to which I meant to advert is that, since we have known
much about the human brain and the nervous system connected
with it, it has not been found that, in its several
parts and in the action of the nerves connected with it, it
has been differently organized and acted upon in the lowest
savages from what we know of it in the European and the
most civilized races. There is a difference in volume, but
not in the organization or the office of the brain in different
races of men, as there is in different individuals of the
same race. The fact that all men, since they became a
completed type of animal, however they originated and became
men, have possessed a capacity to become in different
degrees intelligent and thinking beings, points strongly to
the conclusion that while in each individual there is a nervous
system so organized as to transmit impressions from external
objects to the central physical organ called the brain,
there must be another existence in that individual, of a
spiritual and intellectual nature, of a substance that is
not physical, to which the brain supplies the materials of
thought, thought being mental cognition of an idea. If I
am asked for the proof of such an existence, I answer that
the proof is consciousness, as I define it, and this I conceive
is the highest kind of proof.</p>

<p>One may appeal to the convictions of mankind for an
answer to the question, What is the highest and most satisfactory
kind of knowledge that any of us possess? The
most intelligent man may be mistaken in that part of self-knowledge
that relates to his own character or motives.
Others may see him very differently from the light in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
he sees himself, and they may be right and he may be
wrong. He may think, too, that he knows a great deal
that he does not know; but no intelligent man is mistaken
or in any way deluded when he believes in his own existence.
No man in his waking moments and in his right
mind ever confounded his own identity, as we have seen
that Lady Macbeth did when she was walking in her sleep,
with the identity of another person. No man in his right
mind loses the constant, ever-present sense of himself as
a being and as one distinct from all other beings. The
reason is that his own existence is certified to him by the
most unerring of witnesses, one who can not lie, because
the fact of one's own existence is the fact of which that
witness must speak. Of all other facts the witness may
speak falsely. The mind can not speak falsely when it
speaks to us of our own existence, for the witness who speaks
and the person spoken to are one and the same. The falsehood,
if there could be a falsehood, would be instantly detected.</p>

<p>As the mind certifies to itself its own existence by the
most direct and the highest kind of proof, so it certifies to
itself the powers with which it is endowed; and this brings
me to the anatomical examination of the structure of the
mind. I shall not make this analysis a very minute one,
but shall confine it to those distinct elementary powers
which are constituted by systems, as the powers of the
bodily organism are constituted by systems distinguishable
by the functions which they perform. In the bodily organism
we recognize the digestive system, the system of
circulation of the blood, the muscular system, the nervous
system, the sensory system, which is distributed into the different
organs of sense, the male and female systems of sexual
generation, and the female system of gestation. These
several systems, acting together as one complex mechanism
endowed with the mysterious principle of life, form in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
human being of either sex the physical existence of the individual.
Acting in each individual of either sex simultaneously
and with mutual involved interdependencies,
they form a whole which, in its several parts and their
functions, may be likened to the several parts and functions
in one of those machines which we ourselves construct&mdash;with
this difference, however, that in one life is present
and in the other it is not. The fundamental question is
whether this complex animal mechanism, thus constituted
of certain physical systems, also constitutes during this life
the entire individual. If so, the individual existence is a
unit, and, when the physical organism perishes by what we
call death, the individual existence ceases. If, on the contrary,
we have satisfactory proof that there is, during this
life, in each individual an organized and extended entity,
composed, like the systems of the bodily organisms, of certain
systems of its own but of a substance that is not material,
then the existence of each individual is a dual existence;
and one of the two existences now associated and acting together
may be dissolved into its original material elements,
while the other, composed of a different substance, may be
indissoluble and have an endless life. There is no middle
ground that I can perceive between these two hypotheses.
One or the other of them is absolutely true, independent
of the inquiry as to the mode in which mind came to exist;
for after going through with all the reasoning and all
the proofs that are supposed to show its origin by the process
called evolution, we must still come back to the question
of what mind is after it has come into existence; must
determine on which side lies the preponderating probability
of its continuance after the death of the body; and must
accept the conclusion of its destruction or cessation when
the body dies, or the other conclusion that it is unlike the
body in its substance, and therefore indestructible by the
means which destroy the body. For this reason we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
examine the mind for proof that it is an organism of a special
nature because composed of a special substance, and
this proof is to be reached by an analysis of the systems of
which the mind is composed. I select, of course, for the
purposes of this analysis, any individual whose physical and
mental faculties have had the average development into the
condition that is called a sound mind in a sound body&mdash;<i lang="la">mens
sana in corpore sano</i>. I shall treat incidentally of
the condition of idiocy.</p>

<p>We may classify the distinct systems of the mind, with
their several functions, as easily as we can classify the distinct
systems of our physical structure and their functions.
I have seen the systems of the mind distributed into five;
and although I do not adopt the whole analysis made by
the writer to whom I refer, or make use of the same terminology,
I shall follow his classification because it is
one which any thinking person must recognize as a description
of mental powers of which he is conscious.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> We are
all aware that we possess the following mental systems in
which inhere certain elementary powers that are mental
powers:</p>

<p>1. A sensory system, by which the mind takes impressions
from matter.</p>

<p>2. A system of intellectual faculties, such as reason,
imagination, reflection, combination of ideas, discrimination
between different ideas.</p>

<p>3. A system of emotions, or susceptibilities to pleasure
or pain, of a moral and intellectual nature as distinguished
from the pleasurable or painful excitation of our nerves.</p>

<p>4. A system of desires, which prompt us to wish for
and acquire some good, or to avoid some evil.</p>

<p>5. A system of affections, which prompt us to like or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
dislike persons, things, situations, and whatever is attractive
or unattractive, as the case may be.</p>

<p>A little further analysis of each of these systems will
explain why they are respectively to be thus classified as
distinguishable organic powers or functions of the human
mind:</p>

<p><em>First.</em> The mind is placed as a recipient in correspondence
with the material universe through the nerves of sensation
and the special corporeal organs, whereby the properties
of matter become to some extent known to us. As
the power of the physical senses to obtain for us a knowledge
of the properties of matter is limited, even when our
senses are in the utmost state of their normal capacity,
there may be properties of matter which will never become
known to us in our present existence. But certain of its
properties do become known to us, and we are perfectly
aware that this takes place through our physical organs of
sense, which convey to our mental reception certain impressions.
This power of the mind, therefore, to receive such
impressions, to retain and transmute them into thought, is
to be recognized as a power exerted by means of an organic
physical contrivance and an organic mental structure, the
two acting together, the resultant being the mind's faculty
for receiving ideas from the external world. Let us suppose,
then, that the bodily senses are impaired by the partial
destruction of their organs. It does not follow that
the knowledge which has been derived from them, when
they were in full activity, is destroyed; all that happens
is that we acquire no more of such knowledge by the same
means, or do not acquire it so readily and completely. If
the destruction of the physical senses is so complete as it becomes
when death of the whole body takes place, the materials
derived from the impressions conveyed to the mind
from external objects during life have been transmuted
into ideas and thoughts, and, as that which holds the ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
and the thoughts is of a substance unlike in nature to the
substance of the physical organs which conveyed the impressions,
the rational conclusion is that the ideas and
thoughts will continue to be held by it, after the dissolution
of the body, as they were held while the body was in
full life.</p>

<p><em>Second.</em> I recognize in the mind a system of intellectual
faculties. Of intellect, I should say that the ascertainment
of truth is its primary function; and hence I
should say that the power of retaining permanent possession
of truth already ascertained is the means by which we
maintain continued ascertainment, or the utilization of
truth already ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> For the exercise of this power
of ascertaining, holding, applying, and expressing truth&mdash;the
processes of intellect&mdash;we have three recognized faculties.
These are the intuitive faculty; the faculty of association
or combination; and the introspective faculty, or the capacity
to look inward upon the processes of our own minds.
The philosophers who maintain that all our knowledge is
derived from experience admit neither the intuitive faculty
nor the fact of intuition. On the other hand, the
philosophers who maintain, as Mr. Spencer does, that the
brain of every infant is an organized register of the experiences
of his ancestors, do not allow of the existence of any
intuitions as facts in the individual life of the infant, because
they regard the individual experiences of the infant
as mere repetitions of former experiences that took place in
its progenitors. But rightly regarded the true meaning
of the intuitive faculty is this: that at the instant when a
new sensory impression is received by the infant, or the
adult, there is an innate and implanted power which comes
into play, by which is asserted the reality of that from
which the sensory impression is received. This power, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
intuitive faculty, is infallible. It was ordained as the
means by which a sensory impression becomes to us a reality.
We are so constructed, mentally, that we must believe
those primary facts which the sensory impressions
certify to us to be facts. On the veracity of this certification
we are absolutely dependent, because we can not contradict
the affirmations of reality which causation makes
to our intuitive mental perceptions. On this veracity we
risk our lives; we could not be safe if we were not subjected
to this belief. Intuition, therefore, is something
anterior to experience; it is that power by which the first
experience and the last become to us the means of belief in
a reality. This is a power that can belong to and inhere
in a spiritual organism alone. We must, therefore, recognize
in the infant this original implanted endowment, the
capacity to be mentally convinced of realities; and while,
in order to meet the first exercise of this capacity there must be
a physical organism which will conduct the sensory impressions
to the brain and a brain that will receive them, the
capacity of the infant to have its first conviction of the
reality certified to it by the sensory impression is at once
the capacity of an intellectual being, and a necessity imposed
upon him by the law of his existence. Idiocy, when
complete, is the absence of this capacity, by reason of some
failure of connection between the brain, as the central recipient
of sensory impressions, and the mind which should
receive and transmute those impressions into thought. We
are scarcely warranted in regarding the idiot as a human
animal possessed of no mind whatever. The absolute idiot
should be defined as a human creature whom we can not
educate at all&mdash;in whom we can awaken no intelligence;
but we are not therefore authorized in believing that there
is no provision whatever for the development of intelligence
after the mere physical life of the body is ended. Absolute
idiocy, or what, from our as yet imperfect means of devel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>oping
intelligence in such unfortunate persons we must
regard as at present absolute, is probably very rare. Between
human creatures so born and those vast multitudes
in whom average intelligence is developed by surrounding
influences, whatever they may be, there are various degrees
of the capacity for development; and what happens in
these intermediate cases proves that there are different degrees
in which the connection between the physical and the
mental organism is established at birth, so that in some the
connection may be said to be abnormal and imperfect,
while in the enormous majority it is at least so nearly normal
and complete that intelligence may be developed.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the place to advert to Mr. Spencer's assertion
that the doctrine that intelligence in the human being
is wholly produced by experience is utterly inadmissible;
that it makes the presence of a brain meaningless, and
idiocy unaccountable. A doctrine which imputes the development
of intelligence <em>wholly</em> to the experience of the
individual is of course untenable. There must be a brain
and a nervous system; but we are not warranted, in the
case of the idiot, in assuming that he has a differently organized
brain and nervous system from those of his parents
or others of the human race, as Mr. Spencer appears to me
to assume. What we are warranted in believing is that
while the brain and nervous system of the idiot child may
be just as complete in his structure as in those of the parents,
there has somehow occurred, from some cause, antecedent
in some cases to birth, but operating after birth in
other cases, a failure of the adequate connection between
the brain and the mind, so that intelligence can not be developed
at all, or can be developed but partially. The individual
may have inherited just as good an "organized
register" of the experience of his ancestors&mdash;just as good a
natural brain as his brothers and sisters who are perhaps
highly intelligent from their birth, or capable of becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
intelligent. Yet he lacks the ability to co-ordinate impressions
and to perform the actions appropriate to those impressions,
because there has failed to be established in him
the necessary connection between the impressions and the
sensory intellectual system which constitutes one organic
part of the mind. The experiences, however often repeated,
of the impressions produced by his physical senses
on his brain, remain there as corporeal feelings. They
reach no further. They do not become transmuted into
ideas, and so intelligence can not be developed, or is developed
but to a very feeble extent. Instead of saying that
"the gradually increasing intelligence displayed throughout
childhood is more attributable to the completion of the
cerebral organization than to the individual experiences,"
I should say that it is most attributable to the presence of
an established connection between the function of the cerebral
organization and the mental receptivity of impressions,
which is not merely passive, but is incessantly active because
incessantly receiving, and that, where this connection
is wanting, the receptivity, although it may exist, can not
become active, and so intelligence can not be developed in
this life. But there may be another state of existence, in
which the mind of the idiot, no longer dependent on a
physical organization of brain and nervous system for the
reception of ideas and for intellectual growth, but retaining
its capacity for mental development, may begin and carry
on such development by other means; whereas, if the brain
and the nervous system constitute all there is of any human
being, whether born an idiot or born capable of intellectual
growth through his individual experiences, he can have no
future after that brain and nervous system are destroyed,
unless we suppose that mind is something that has been
developed out of matter into a spiritual existence&mdash;a supposition
which is to me inconceivable.</p>

<p>The second of the intellectual faculties is the associa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>tive,
or that intuitive power by which ideas are combined
and associated or held in disjunction and separation. I
regard this as an intuitive faculty, because, as our observation
teaches us, its presence and power, manifested at the
first dawning of infantile intelligence, are attested by every
exercise of the organs through which the external world
reaches our minds, to the last moment of our mortal existence.
Experience is, of course, necessary to the first action
of this intuitive faculty. This is only another way of saying
that there must occur a sensory impression upon the
brain which becomes transmuted into the idea of the external
object, and then a repetition of that impression produces
a repetition of the idea, and the associative faculty
combines or disjoins them. But unless there exists an intuitive
power, inherent in the intellective system, whereby
the first idea and the second can be associated and compared,
there can be no knowledge, no acquisition of truth,
because the sensory impressions will stop in the brain as so
many feelings excited through the nervous system, instead
of being transmuted into thought.</p>

<p>The introspective faculty, on the other hand, does not
deal solely with sensory impressions, or with the ideas
which they have suggested. It is that power of the mind
by which it can look inward upon itself. This is seemingly
a paradox; but nevertheless, the existence of such a
faculty is a necessary hypothesis, not only because we are
conscious of it, but because without it we could have no
means of analyzing our own mental structure, although we
could make some very partial analysis of the mind of another
individual by studying his actions. As regards ourselves,
it is as if our visual organs possessed the power of
looking at the process by which an image of an external
object is impressed upon the retina and is thence transmitted
to the brain, where the sensory impression is produced.
This, of course, is a physical impossibility. All we can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
is to examine the physical structure of the eye, with its
wonderful provision of lenses and other means for the reception
and the effect of light, and to reason upon what we
can discover that the process of what is called seeing must
be thus or thus. But that process itself we can not see by
the same organs by which it is carried on. In the case of
the mind, however&mdash;and herein is one of the remarkable
proofs of its unlikeness as an organism to the bodily organism&mdash;there
is a power to witness, to observe, to be sensible
of its own operations. This power, like all the other
mental powers, may be very feeble in some individuals, for
want of exercise, but in others, from long and frequent exercise,
it may become exceedingly vigorous, and be the
means of advancing mental philosophy if its observations
are preserved and recorded. It is one of the systems which,
as a whole, constitute the spiritual organism to which we
give the name of mind. Such a capacity can not be predicated
of a physical organism. It is impossible for us to
conceive of a machine standing and looking upon its own
operations, speculating upon their improvement, or thinking
of the relation of its mechanism to the human author
of its being. It is equally impossible for us to think of the
body of man contemplating its own existence, or being sensible
of it; but it is perfectly easy to conceive of its being
known to the mind that inhabits it, which takes cognizance
both of its own operations and of the operations of the
physical organism, reflects upon them separately or in their
action upon one another, and spontaneously refers both to
an author.</p>

<p><em>Third.</em> I have placed third in the category of mental
systems the system of emotions or susceptibilities to mental
pleasure or pain, as distinguished from the pleasurable or
painful excitation of our nervous system. No one can
doubt that, however powerful may be the influence upon
our mental states of physical pain or physical sensations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
that are pleasurable, there is such a thing as mental pain
and mental pleasure, satisfaction or dissatisfaction, wholly
unconnected with and in no way dependent upon our corporeal
feelings, present or past. It is from this susceptibility
to mental pain or pleasure that we come to have the
idea of goodness or badness, which is originally a classification
of the qualities of external things as good or bad; the
good being those which affect us pleasurably, and the bad
those which affect us painfully. By our mental organization
we are placed in such correspondence with the material
universe, that things apart from ourselves affect us
agreeably or disagreeably; sights, sounds, odors, and tastes
give us pleasure or pain. We are also placed in correspondence
with the spiritual universe, and thereby certain acts,
relations, and traits of character give us pleasure, or the
reverse. In process of time, the youth whose mental systems
are in the course of expansion comes to perceive that
his own acts give him pleasure or pain, and hence he derives
the perception of good or bad qualities in himself.
Moral goodness in ourselves&mdash;goodness of disposition, of
intention, of volition, of habit&mdash;is found to be distinct from
physical and intellectual goodness; and thus the consciousness
of moral goodness becomes the intellectual faculty to
which moral commands can be addressed, with a prospect
that the connection between obedience and happiness will
be perceived. This susceptibility to mental pain or pleasure,
from the qualities of external things, from the acts and
dispositions of other persons, and from our own, is one that
can inhere in a mental organization, but it can not possibly
inhere in a physical organism. The physical organism is
undoubtedly the means by which the mental susceptibility
to pleasure or pain is reached from the external universe;
but, unless there is a mental organism to feel the pleasure
or the pain, the action of the physical organization is nothing
but the excitation of the nervous system. I, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
make a distinct class among the mental systems, and assign
to it the faculty of experiencing mental pleasure or mental
pain as a capacity distinct from the pleasurable or painful
excitation of our nerves.</p>

<p><em>Fourth.</em> In the category of mental systems may be placed
those desires which lead us to wish for and strive to obtain
some good or to avoid some evil. This, surely, is not to
be regarded as anything but an intellectual perception of
what is to us a good or an evil. It is a structural capacity
of the soul which, after an experience of that which we
learn to be good for us, or the reverse of good, is always
prompting us to take the steps or to perform the acts which
will insure a repetition of that experience, in the acquisition
of further good or the avoidance of further evil. Its
operations may be perverted. We may, from bad habits or
erroneous ideas of good and evil, pursue objects that are
pernicious. But whether we strive for that which is truly
good, or is deceptively regarded as a good, we are perpetually
acting under the impulse of a desire that is implanted
in us, and that operates as a desire whether its objects are
worthy or unworthy, beneficial or injurious, noxious or innoxious
to our moral health.</p>

<p><em>Fifth</em>, and lastly, we may classify the affections as one
of the structural systems of our spiritual existence. It is
that part of our natures that makes us like or dislike both
persons and things; and, in regard to the former, it is the
capacity for love in its high distinction from the physical
appetite of sexual passion. The range of its operation is
most various and multiform, but throughout all of its
operations it is a spiritual capacity, implanted in us for
our happiness as spiritual beings.</p>

<p>If it is objected that this is an arbitrary classification&mdash;that
as an analysis of structural systems in our mental organization
it bears no analogy to the anatomical exploration
and classification of the structural systems of our phys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>ical
organism&mdash;the answer is, that in regard to the latter
we make the examination by the exercise of our corporeal
senses, chiefly by the visual organs, as we do in the case of
all other organized matter. In analyzing the structural
organization of our minds, we are examining a subject that
is not laid bare to the inspection of any of our corporeal
organs; the scalpel in the hand of the dissector can afford
us no aid in this investigation, but the inspection must be
carried on by turning the eye of the mind inward upon
itself. This we are mentally constituted to do. While,
therefore, it may be true that the classification which I
have made, or which may have been made by others, of the
structural mental systems, is in one sense arbitrary, and
while in any method of describing them they may run into
or overlap one another in a complex organism, it will always
remain true that the mind is capable of such examinations,
and that the analysis, however given, is useful to
the comprehension of the mind as an organized and extended
entity. No one can carry on this mental examination
without perceiving that he is examining a something
which has an independent existence and a life of its own,
whether he supposes it to have been evolved out of organized
matter, or embraces the idea of its distinct and special
creation by an exercise of the Divine Will.</p>

<p>The two main hypotheses concerning the origin of mind
may now be contrasted. In the long process of development
of animal organisms out of one another there come
to be, it is said, higher and higher degrees of intelligence,
as the nervous system becomes more and more capable of
complex impressions, until we arrive at the consummate
physical organization and the supreme intelligence of the
human race. The physical organization is open to our examination,
and we find the human brain divided into cerebral
masses, with ganglia of sensory nerves extending to
the external sensory organs. Intelligence is the faculty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
comprehending by previous preparation the combinations
of impressions made on the brain through the sensory
nerves. The brain being an organized register in which
the experiences of progenitors have accumulated a high degree
of this faculty, each human infant born into the world
comes into it with a prepared capacity to acquire the combinations
of impressions produced in his individual experience.
Transmitted from generation to generation, this
inherited capacity becomes the means by which each individual
manifests and enjoys what we call intelligence; and
the resulting aggregate of all the faculties thus called into
exercise is what we denominate mind. It must be observed,
however, that this theory or explanation of the origin of
mind, rejecting the hypothesis of its special creation as a
being of a spiritual nature, assumes it to be a something
which has been developed out of the growth and improvement
of a physical organism. When you inquire whether
the nature of this something is supposed to be a product of
a different substance from matter, although developed out
of matter, you are left without an answer; and when you
press the inquiry whether a spiritual existence can be conceived
as having grown out of the action of a physical organism,
you are told that there are no means of determining
what a spiritual existence is, because there is nothing
with which you can compare it so as to ascertain what it
resembles or what it does not resemble. Or if there are
some who accept the evolution theory of the origin of mind,
and who think it possible that a spiritual existence can
owe its origin to the action of matter without any intervention
of a creating power purposely giving existence to a
spiritual essence, you have to ask a question to which you
can only get this answer: that it has pleased the Almighty
Being to establish a system by which a spiritual in contradistinction
to a physical existence has been developed in
countless ages out of the action of material substances or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>ganized
into definite systems and endowed with the principle
of life. Those who assume this hypothesis must necessarily
assume also that the spiritual existence is, after it has
come into being, an existence distinct from the physical
organism, although generated out of it, and then they must
encounter the further inquiry as to the probability of the
supposed method of production resorted to by the Supreme
Being.</p>

<p>More than once in the course of our colloquies I have
had occasion to say that, in all our inquiries of this nature,
whether in regard to the origin of our physical organism or
that of our mental existence, we must constantly bear in
mind the unbounded capacity of the Creator to adopt any
method of production whatever; that it is just as much
within his power to call things of the most opposite natures
into existence by a single word as it is to establish methods
by which they shall be developed through innumerable ages
of what we call time. That the Being who is supposed to
preside over the universe and to hold this unlimited power
is an hypothesis I readily admit; but I affirm that his existence
and attributes are necessary postulates, without which
there can be no reasoning concerning the origin of anything.
Whether that Being exists and possesses the attributes
which we impute to him I have all along said is a
matter of which we must be satisfied by independent proofs
before we undertake to investigate his probable methods.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of the origin of mind which I now mean
to contrast with that of the evolutionists may be stated as
follows: It is a rational deduction, from all that we know
of our physical organism, that procreation of new individuals
of that organism by the sexual union of male and female
was established as the means of continuing the species of
animal known as man. When or how established is not
a material part of the inquiry that I now make. It may
have been that the division of the sexes came about by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
very slow process, or it may have been by the aboriginal
creation of a completed pair, male and female. However
or whenever it came to exist, there came to be one uniform
method of bringing into existence new individuals of a
peculiar and perfectly distinguishable animal type. If we
confine our attention to the physical organism of man, it
is perfectly apparent that when procreation and gestation
take place they happen because of the established law that
a new individual of this species of animal shall be produced
by the sexual union of two other individuals, male and female,
and that the new individual shall have the same physical
organism as the parents. A new physical life thus
springs out of two other physical lives by a process the
secret of which we can not detect, although we can trace it
through some of its stages so far as to see that there is a
secret process by which two physical organisms give existence
to another physical organism of the same type and
having the same principle of life.</p>

<p>As the new individual animal grows into further development,
we find that along with his animal organism and
united with it by a tie which we can not see, but about
which we can reason, there is apparently present a kind of
life that is something more than the life of the body. The
further we carry our investigations of the phenomena which
indicate the existence of this mental life, the more we become
convinced that it is the life of a spiritual organism.
As the Creator had the power to give existence to the corporeal
organism, why had he not an equal power to give
existence to a spiritual organism? If he established the
law of sexual union between a male and a female in order
to perpetuate the type of animal to which they belong&mdash;the
law which gives existence to a new individual of that animal
type every time that a new conception and a new birth take
place&mdash;why should he not have established the collateral
law that every time there is a new birth of an infant there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
shall come into existence a spiritual entity which shall be
united to the corporeal organism for a time, thus constituting
in that infant a dual existence which makes his
whole individuality during this life? If we suppose that
the physical organism of our double natures was left to be
worked out by a very slow process, by which physical organisms
are developed out of one another&mdash;or by which we
theoretically suppose them to have been so developed&mdash;why
is it necessary to suppose that our spirits or souls have been
developed in the same way or by an analogous method?
What reason have we to believe that the Creator works by
the same methods in the spiritual world, or by methods
that are of the same nature as those which we think we can
discover to be his methods in giving existence to corporeal
organisms? The two realms of spirit and matter are so
completely unlike that we are not compelled to believe that
the methods by which creation of organisms of the two
kinds are effected by the Almighty are necessarily or probably
the same.</p>

<p>In order to be clearly understood I will now repeat my
hypothesis in a distinct form. I assume the existence of a
pair of animals of the human type, male and female, endowed
with the power of producing new individuals of the
same type. In their physical organisms is established the
law of procreation, and in the female counterpart of that organism
is established the concomitant law of conception and
parturition. Thus far provision is made for the production
of a new individual physically organized like the parents. In
those parents there is also established another law, by the
operation of which the same process which results in the
production of the new individual animal organism brings
into existence a spiritual organism, which is united with and
becomes the companion of the physical organism so long as
the latter shall continue to live. These laws established in
the first pair and in every succeeding pair continue to op<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>erate
through every succeeding generation. Perhaps it will
be said that this attributes the production of a spiritual organism
to a physical process; but, in truth, it does no more
than to assert the simultaneous production of the two existences.
It is not necessary to assume that the fœtus
which becomes at birth the human infant is before birth
animated by a soul; for it is not necessary to suppose, nor
is it apparently true, that the physical organism is complete
until birth takes place and the breath of life enters the
lungs, thus constituting a new life other than that of the
fœtus or the unborn child, although the one is a continuation
of the other. At whatever point of time the complete
animal organism is in a condition to be observed so that we
can say here is a living child, at that point we begin to
perceive a capacity to receive impressions from the external
world without the connection that has theretofore existed
between the unborn child and the maternal system. This
capacity must either be attributed to the individual experience
of the infant, so that without experience of his own he
can not begin to be possessed of a growing intelligence, or
it must be imputed to an innate and implanted power resident
in a spiritual organism that comes into exercise whenever
the physical organism has begun to draw the breath of
life.</p>

<p>The evolution hypothesis of the origin of the human
mind necessarily leaves its nature in an indeterminate state
that will not satisfy the requirements of sound reasoning.
In one mode of stating and reasoning upon this hypothesis
it is assumed that there is not now and never was a mental
existence that was created in each individual of the race at
his birth; but that at some very remote period in the history
of successive animal organisms there was produced an
animal of a highly developed nervous structure, capable of
intelligence by reason of a superior power of receiving physical
impressions and co-ordinating them into states of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>sciousness
which correspond to the physical feelings; and
to the perpetually recurring series of these states of consciousness
we give the name of mind. This capacity of intelligence
is transmitted from parents to offspring, the experiences
of the former being registered in the brain of the
latter; but however complete may be the inherited nervous
structure, and however great the capacity for intelligence,
mind in each individual of the race is evidenced by nothing
but a constant succession and variation of certain states of
feelings produced in the nervous structure.</p>

<p>Against this view we may place what we know from
constant observation. We know that it has been ordained,
as a consequence of the sexual union of two individuals of
opposite sex, there shall come into existence a new individual
of the same physical organism as the parents. Of
the interior process by which this product is effected we
must remain ignorant, but about the fact there can be no
doubt. That fact is, that by the union of certain vesicles
contributed by each of the parents there results a new individual
organism. We know further that simultaneously
with the complete production of the new physical organism,
there comes into being, and is incorporated with it, an existence
that we are compelled by the phenomena which it
manifests to regard as a non-physical and a spiritual organism.
Of the process by which this distinct existence is
effected, we must remain as ignorant as we are of the process
by which the physical organism was made to result
from the sexual union of the parents. But of the fact
there can be no more doubt in the one case than in the
other. In every instance of a new birth of a perfect infant,
we know that there results a dual existence in the same
individual; the one manifested by physical, the other by
mental phenomena. To argue that the mental and spiritual
existence grew out of an improved and improving physical
organism in long-past ages, and became an adjunct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
to that organism after it had attained a certain development,
without any intervention of the creating power at
each new birth of an individual infant, is to limit the power
of the Creator in a realm wherein the subject of his creating
power is essentially unlike the subject with which he deals
when he deals with physical organisms. In all reasoning
upon the origin and nature of the human mind, the boundless
power of the Creator must be assumed. In judging of
the probabilities of his methods of action, it is the safest
course to be guided by what we can see takes place at every
new birth of a human infant. The physical organism results
from the operation of a certain law. The mental organism
results, it is alike rational to presume, from the
operation of a certain other law. How either of these laws
operates we are not permitted to know, but we can as safely
infer the one as the other, from what is open to our observation.</p>

<p>I shall now touch briefly upon another argument, the
foundation of which is to be tested by historical facts into
the truth of which I shall not here inquire, because they
must, for the purposes for which I use them, be assumed.
The immortality of the human soul is said to have been
proved by a Divine revelation. This great fact is supposed
to be established by evidence of a character quite different
from that which convinces us of the existence and attributes
of the Almighty. But, assuming revelation to be a
fact, it has an important bearing upon the subject of this
essay, because the question arises, for what conceivable reason
the Almighty should have made to us a revelation of
our immortality, through the direct testimony of a competent
witness, if we are not spiritual beings. Information
of a fact supposes that there was a person to be informed.
Concurrently with the consciousness which assures us of our
personality, we have the assurance of our immortality certified
to us by a messenger expressly authorized to give us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
the information. If the mind, or that part of our individuality
which we call the soul, is in its origin and nature
nothing but what the evolution theory supposes, what was
there to be informed of immortality, or of anything else?
The possibility and certainty of an existence after the death
of the body is a conviction that must exercise great influence
over the conduct of men in this life. It is consistent
with the whole apparent scheme of the revelation to suppose
that it was made for a twofold purpose: first, to cause
men to lead better lives in this world than they might have
led without this information and conviction; and, secondly,
to form them for greater happiness in another world. The
first of these purposes might have been effectuated by causing
men to believe in their own immortality, notwithstanding
the belief might be a delusion because there is no being
capable, in fact, of any existence after the life of the body
is ended. But such a method of action is hardly to be imputed
to the Creator and Supreme Governor of the universe,
according to the ideas of his character which natural
religion alone will give us. It is not in accordance with
rational conceptions of his attributes to suppose that he deludes
his rational creatures with assurances or apparent
proofs of something that is not true for the sake of making
them act as if it were true. When we find ourselves running
into a hypothesis of this kind, we may be pretty sure
that we are departing from correct principles of reasoning.
In regard to the second of the supposed purposes for which
the revelation of immortality was made&mdash;to form men for
greater happiness in another state of existence&mdash;it is quite
obvious that the supposed scheme of the revelation is a
mere delusion, if we are not beings capable of a continued
spiritual existence after the death of our bodies. It is therefore
a matter of great consequence to determine what the
evolution theory of the origin and nature of the human
mind makes us out to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>

<p>I have never seen any statement of that theory that
does not lead to the conclusion that man is a highly developed
animal organism, whose mental existence is not something
created in each individual of the race, and of a substance
and organized structure different from the physical
organism, but whose mental phenomena are merely exhibitions
and effects of occurrences taking place in the physical
system, and assuming the shape of what for distinctness
is called thought. In whatever form this theory has
been stated by its most distinguished professors, it leaves
only an interval of degree, and not an interval of kind,
between the mind of man and that which, in some of
the other animals, is supposed to be mind. The evolution
doctrine, taken in one of its aspects, supposes one grand
chain of animal organisms, rising higher and higher in the
scale of animal life, but connected together by ordinary
generation, so that they are of one kindred throughout;
but that, as each distinct species grows out of predecessors,
by gradual improvements and increments, forming more
and more elaborate organisms, man is the consummate
product of the whole process. But when we ask at what
point or stage in the series of developing animal organisms
the mind of man was produced, or what it was when produced,
we get no satisfactory answer. To the first question,
it can only be answered, as Darwin himself answers,
that there must be a definition of man before we can determine
at what time he came to exist. To the second question,
we have answers which differ materially from each
other. First, we have whatever we can extract from such
a system of psychology as Mr. Spencer's, which ignores the
capability of the mind to exist independent of the nervous
structure and the brain, because it excludes the idea of any
ego, any me, any person, and makes consciousness to consist
of a connected series of physical feelings, to which
there are corresponding psychical equivalents that he calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
mental states. It would seem to follow, therefore, that
when there is no longer remaining for the individual any
nervous structure and any brain, the mental states, or psychical
side of the physical impressions, must cease; or, in
other words, that the only existing ego has come to an end.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have seen an ingenious hypothesis
which it is well to refer to, because it illustrates the
efforts that are often made to reconcile the doctrines of
evolution with a belief in immortality. This hypothesis by
no means ignores the possibility of a spiritual existence, or
the spiritual as distinguished from the material world.
But it assumes that man was produced under the operation
of physical laws; and that after he had become a completed
product&mdash;the consummate and finished end of the whole
process of evolution&mdash;he passed under the dominion and
operation of other and different laws, and is saved from
annihilation by the intervention of a change from the physical
to the spiritual laws of his Creator. Put into a condensed
form, this theory has been thus stated: Having
spent countless æons in forming man, by the slow process of
animal evolution, God will not suffer him to fall back into
elemental flames, and be consumed by the further operation
of physical laws, but will transfer him into the dominion
of the spiritual laws that are held in reserve for his
salvation.</p>

<p>One of the first questions to be asked, in reference to
this hypothesis, is, Who or what is it that God is supposed
to have spent countless æons in creating by the slow process
of animal evolution? If we contemplate a single specimen
of the human race, we find a bodily organism, endowed
with life like that of other animals, and acted upon by
physical laws throughout the whole period of its existence.
We also find present in the same individual a mental existence,
which is certified to us by evidence entirely different
from that by which we obtain a knowledge of the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
organism. As the methods employed by the Creator in the
production of the physical organism, whatever we may suppose
them to have been, were physical laws operating upon
matter, so the methods employed by him in the production
of a spiritual existence must have operated in a domain
that was wholly aside from the physical world. Each of
these distinct realms is equally under the government of an
Omnipotent Being; and while we may suppose that in the
one he employed a very slow process, such as the evolution
of animal organisms out of one another is imagined to have
been, there is no conceivable reason why he should not, in
the other and very different realm, have resorted to the
direct creation of a spiritual existence, which can not, in
the nature of things, have required to be produced by the
action of physical laws. When, at the birth of each individual
of the human race, the two existences become
united, when, in consequence of the operation of that
sexual union of the parents which has been ordained for
the production of a new individual, the physical and the
spiritual existence become incorporated in the one being,
the fact that they remain for a certain time mutually dependent
and mutually useful, co-operating in the purposes
of their temporary connection, does not change their essential
nature. The one may be destructible because the operation
of physical laws may dissolve the ligaments that hold
it together; the other may be indestructible, because the
operation of spiritual laws will hold together the spiritual
organism that is in its nature independent of the laws of
matter.</p>

<p>I can therefore see no necessary connection between the
methods employed by the Almighty in the production of
an animal and the methods employed by him in the production
of a soul. That in the birth of the individual the
two come into existence simultaneously, and are temporarily
united in one and the same being, only proves that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
two existences are contemporaneous in their joint inception.
It does not prove that they are of the same nature, or
the same substance, or that the physical organism is the
only ego, or that the psychical existence is nothing but
certain states of the material structure, to whose aggregate
manifestations certain philosophers give the name of mind,
while denying to them personal individuality and the consciousness
of a distinct being.</p>

<p>And now, in bringing this discussion to a close, I will
only add that the great want of this age is the prosecution
of inquiry into the nature of the human mind as an organic
structure, regarded as such. It seems to me that the whole
mission of Science is now perverted by a wrong aim, which
is to find out the external to the neglect of the internal&mdash;to
make all exploration terminate in the laws of the physical
universe, and go aside from the examination of the spiritual
world. It is no reproach to those who essay the latter inquiry
that they are scoffed at as "the metaphysicians." It
matters not what they are called, so long as they pursue the
right path. It is now in regard to the pursuit of science as
it was formerly in regard to the writing of history. That
philosophical French historian, M. Taine, has luminously
marked the change which has come over the methods and
objects of historical studies in the following passage:</p>

<p>"When you consider with your eyes the visible man,
what do you look for? The man invisible. The words which
salute your ears, the gestures, the motions of his head, the
clothes he wears, visible acts and deeds of every kind, are expressions
merely; somewhat is revealed beneath them, and
that is a soul&mdash;an inner man is concealed beneath the outer
man; the second does not reveal the first; ... all the
externals are but avenues converging toward a center; you
enter them simply to reach that center, and that center is
the genuine man&mdash;I mean that mass of faculties and feelings
which are the inner man. We have reached a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
world, which is infinite, because every action which we see
involves an infinite association of reasonings, emotions, sensations
new and old, which have served to bring it to light,
and which, like great rocks deep-seated in the ground, find
in it their end and their level. This under-world is a new
subject-matter proper to the historian.... This precise
and proved interpretation of past sensations has given to
history, in our days, a second birth; hardly anything of
the sort was known to the preceding century. They thought
men of every race and country were all but identical&mdash;the
Greek, the barbarian, the Hindoo, the man of the Renaissance,
and the man of the eighteenth century&mdash;as if they
had all been turned out of a common mold, and all in
conformity to a certain abstract conception which served
for the whole human race. They knew man, but not men;
they had not penetrated to the soul; they had not seen the
infinite diversity and complexity of souls; they did not
know that the moral constitution of a people or an age is
as particular and distinct as the physical structure of a
family of plants or an order of animals."<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>In the same way psychology needs a new birth, like the
new birth of history. If we would know the mind, we
must reach the conviction that there is a mind: and this conviction
can be reached only by penetrating through all the
externals, through the physical organism, through the
diversities of race, through the environment of matter,
until we have found the soul. If history, like zoölogy,
has found its anatomy, mental science must, in like manner,
be prosecuted as an anatomical study. So long as we
allow the anatomy of zoölogy to be the predominant and
only explanation, the beginning and the end of the mental
manifestations, so long we shall fail to comprehend the
nature of man, and to see the reason for his immortality.</p>

include the marsupials and monotremes (<i lang="la">ornithorhynchus</i>).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Galileo's "heresy," that the earth moves round the sun, was condemned
by a papal decree in the sixteenth century as "absurd, philosophically
false, and formally heretical, because it is expressly contrary to Holy
Scripture." No Roman Catholic now dreams of disputing what the Florentine
astronomer maintained; and the evolutionists are perpetually foretelling
that the time will come when to question their doctrine will be admitted
to be as ridiculous as was the papal interdict fulminated against Galileo.
If their doctrine had nothing to confront it but a similar condemnation,
proceeding from some ecclesiastical authority claiming to be "infallible,"
or, if it could be met only by the assertion that it is "contrary to Holy
Scripture," there would be some analogy between the two cases. But there
is a vast unlikeness between the two cases. While the hypothesis of animal
evolution is plainly enough "contrary to Holy Scripture," no one who
has any perception of the weakness of its proofs is obliged to rest his
rejection of it on that ground. If, in the sixteenth century, there had been
as good scientific and physical grounds on which to refute Galileo as there
now are for questioning the doctrine of the evolution of distinct species out
of other species, the papal condemnation would have been superfluous even
for churchmen. We must not forget the age in which we live, or allow
any kind of truth to fail of vindication, from fear of being classed with those
who in some former age have blunderingly mistaken the means of vindicating
truth. Belief in special creations, whatever the Bible may say, does
not now, and in all probability never will, stand on a par with the belief
that the sun moves round the earth.</p></div>

commented on was written and first published in 1840, before the speculations

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The primitive gods of Plato's conception (in the "Timæus") are not
to be confounded with the gods of the poetic and popular faith. As Mr.
Grote has pointed out, there is nothing more remarkable in Plato's writings
than the subtilty and skill with which he contrived to elude the charge of
impiety and infidelity toward the gods of tradition and of the popular
faith. In a passage of the "Timæus," on which Mr. Grote seems to be in
doubt whether it was ironical or sincere, Plato boldly confronts the difficulty
by saying that we must believe competent witnesses whose testimony
we have, respecting the genesis of the remaining gods who have personal
names and were believed in by his contemporaries. For his own part, he
says, he does not pretend to account for their generation. The sons of the
gods, the heroic and sacred families, who must have known their own
fathers and all about their own family affairs, have given us their family
traditions, and we must obey the law and believe. But concerning the
primitive gods, the first progenitors of the remaining gods, we are at
liberty to speculate. The ingenuity of this admission of authority where
authority has spoken, reconcilable with speculation upon matters on which
authority has not spoken, is admirable. Plato, as Mr. Grote has observed,
was willing to incur the risk of one count of the indictment which was
brought against his master Socrates, that of introducing new divine persons.
In legal parlance he might have demurred to this count, as not
charging any offense against the established religion. But the other count,
for not acknowledging the gods whom the city acknowledged, he did not
choose to encounter. As to them, he prudently, and perhaps sarcastically,
accepts the testimony of witnesses who speak by inspiration and authority.
But as to the primitive gods, the progenitors of the gods from whom were
descended the heroic and sacred families of men, he expresses in the
"Timæus" his own convictions, without appealing to authority and without
intimating that he is speaking of mysteries beyond the comprehension of
his reason. The boldness of this flight beyond all authority into the realms
of pure reason is very striking, even if it does end in nothing but probability,
which is all that Plato claims for his theory.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> It must be remembered that, in the formation of the cosmical soul,
the ingredients were the eternal Ideas; of these there could be a remnant
after the cosmical soul was formed. But the cosmical body, which was
formed out of the material elements, comprehended the whole of them, and
there could be no remnant or surplus of them remaining outside. But
portions of them could be borrowed for a limited period of mortal existence,
and would return to their place in the Kosmos when that existence
terminated. If this distinction be carried along, Plato will not be found
to be inconsistent with himself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> It does not distinctly appear what was to become of the rational soul
if it finally failed in the conflict with evil, at the lowest end of the transmigration.
Being immortal, it could not perish. But in providing for it
an opportunity of final success through all the forms of animal life to
which it might be condemned, it would seem that Plato was pressed by a
reluctance to encounter the idea of endless misery. This point, however,
does not obscure his explanation of the process by which species of animals,
and a succession of inferior animals, came to exist.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Mr. Grote has pointed out that in his other writings, notably in the
"Republic" and in the "Leges", Plato is not consistent with this idea that
the gods are responsible for the evil that man causes to himself; and that
in the "Timæus" he plainly makes the Demiurgus responsible, because he
brings, or allows to be brought, an immortal soul down from its star, where
it was living pure, intelligent, and in harmony with reason, and makes it
incur corruption, disturbance, and stupidity, by junction with a mortal
body and two mortal and inferior souls.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> I have omitted the description of the influence of disease induced by
an over-indulgence of appetite, etc., in aiding the process of debasement
from the primitive type. The reader can find this influence developed in
Grote, or can consult the original Greek of the "Timæus." It would appear
that Plato considered the effect of all the appetites, when too much
indulged, as tending in the primitive non-sexual type toward the development
of that lower kind of animal which the gods saw fit to treat as fit only to
become woman.</p></div>

it is apparent that this class of philosophers have constructed a theory

was God who caused matter to evolve out of its own action the substance
or existence that we call mind.</p></div>

to Mr. Darwin's works. In regard to birds, he makes the sexual selection
operate less by the "law of battle" among the males, or by fighting, and
more by the attractions of plumage and voice, by which the males carry on
their rivalry for the choice of the females in pairing. But he attributes the
same effect to the sexual selection in birds as in the other animals, namely,
the transmission to offspring, and chiefly to the male offspring, of those
peculiarities of structure which have given to the male parent the victory
over his competitors.</p></div>

so much attention upon the logical formula with which Mr. Spencer
aims to dispose of the idea of creation. But I have observed, especially
among young persons and others whose habits of thinking are unformed or
not corrected by sound and comprehensive reasoning, a popular reception
of this particular dogma, which makes it necessary to subject it to some
careful analysis. In fact, one of my chief objects in writing this book has
been to contribute what I might to the formation of habits of testing philosophical
and scientific theories by something better than specious assumptions
which can be thrown into the plausible form of logical propositions.
There is nothing more valuable than logic, when its forms represent a true
and correct ratiocination; and, when they do not, there is nothing that is
more delusive. It needs some discipline of mind to enable people to see
when logic is valuable and when it is not.</p></div>

Mr. Spencer means by "direct" proof. In the passage immediately following
the sentence last quoted, he speaks of "the kind and quantity of <em>direct
evidence</em> that all organic beings have gradually arisen," etc., whereas, in a
previous passage, he had admitted that the facts at present assignable in
<em>direct</em> proof of this hypothesis are insufficient. I presume he meant
insufficient in number. (Compare "Biology," i, pp. 351 and 352). Now, I should
say that <em>direct</em> proof of the hypothesis that all animal organisms have
arisen successively out of one another would require more or less positive
evidence of such occurrences; and that the proof which is afforded by what
has taken place within the limits of a single species in the course of successive
generations would be <em>indirect</em> evidence of what may have taken place
in the evolution of different species, because it requires the aid of analogy
to connect the two. I am not aware that there is supposed to be any proof
of the evolution of species out of species, excepting that which is derived
from what has taken place in single races in the development of the ovum
into the infant, the development of the infant into the mature animal, and
the limited varieties of structure appearing among individuals of the same
race. As I go on through the examination of Mr. Spencer's argument, it
will appear whether there are grounds for regarding this kind of reasoning
as satisfactory or the reverse.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74" id="Footnote_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> I have stated here, in reference to the pedigree of an individual, a far
more liberal rule of evidence than would probably be allowed in courts of
justice, where anything of value was depending upon the establishment of
a descent from a certain ancestor. But I have purposely suggested the
broadest rule that can be applied to family or race resemblances as a means
of aiding a pedigree in popular determination or in a <em>judicium rusticum</em>.
For example, suppose that there were persons now living in this country
who trace their descent from the English husband of Pocahontas, the
daughter of an Indian chief, and from her. They bear, we will suppose,
the family name of the Englishman whom she is known to have married,
and perhaps one of them bears very strong resemblance to the Indian race
in features, complexion, and hair. In a judicial trial of this person's supposed
pedigree I do not suppose that these resemblances, if they constituted
his sole evidence, together with the name of Rolfe which he bears, and
which a certain number of his ancestors may have borne before him, would
be received as evidence of his descent from the Indian girl whose name was
Pocahontas, and who married an Englishman of the name of Rolfe more
than two centuries ago. It would be necessary to make some proof of the
whole pedigree by the kind of evidence which the law admits in such cases,
and then the resemblances of the individual to the Indian race might possibly
be received as confirmatory proof, in aid of the proof derived from
the family name of Pocahontas's English husband, from reputation, written
or oral declarations of deceased witnesses, family documents, ancient gravestones,
and the like. In popular judgment most persons would be apt to
accept the family name of Rolfe and the apparent trace of Indian blood as
sufficient proof of the descent of the individual from the Indian girl who
married John Rolfe. But in a court of justice these facts would go for
nothing without some independent proof of the pedigree.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_77" id="Footnote_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> Mr. Spencer observes that the hypothesis of special creations is one
"which formulates absolute ignorance into a semblance of positive knowledge...."
Thus, however regarded, the hypothesis of special creations
turns out to be worthless&mdash;worthless by its derivation; worthless in its intrinsic
incoherence; worthless as absolutely without evidence; worthless as
not satisfying a moral want. "We must therefore consider it as counting
for nothing, in opposition to any other hypothesis respecting the origin of
organic beings." There is a great deal more in the same tone. (See "Biology,"
i, pp. 344, 345, and <em>passim</em> throughout Chapters II and III of Part
III of that work.) Mr. Darwin, who is sufficiently positive, is much more
moderate, and in my opinion a much better reasoner, although I can not
subscribe to his reasoning or his conclusions. A rather irreverent naval
officer of my acquaintance once extolled a doctrinal sermon, which he had
just heard preached by a Unitarian clergyman, in this fashion: "I tell you
what, sir, the preacher did not leave the Trinity a leg to stand upon."
Probably some of Mr. Spencer's readers think that he has equally demolished
the doctrine of special creations.</p></div>

the gods, as given in his various writings, are of course unimportant in
reference to the present discussion. In the "Timæus," as Mr. Grote has
pointed out, Plato "accepts the received genealogy of the gods, upon the
authority of the sons and early descendants of the gods. These eons must
have known their own fathers; we ought, therefore, to 'follow the law
and believe them,' though they spoke without either probable or demonstrative
proof.... That which Plato here enjoins to be believed is the
genealogy of Hesiod and other poets, though he does not expressly name
the poets." (Grote, iii, p. 189, note.) In other words, the sons of the gods
are authoritative witnesses to their genealogy, whose <em>ipsi diximus</em> must be
believed. On the other hand, in his "Republic" and "Leges," Plato rejects
the authority of those witnesses, and boldly proclaims that their legends
are fictions, which must be displaced by better fictions, more consonant to
a true ethical conception of the characters of the gods. It is the province
of the lawgiver to supply these better legends, but they are all the while
fictions, although the multitude do not know that they are so. Mr. Grote
accounts for these and other discrepancies in the writings of Plato by explaining
that his different dialogues are not interdependent productions,
but separate disquisitions. (See his admirable and critical examination of
the Platonic canon, in Chapters IV, V, VI, of his first volume.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_141" id="Footnote_141"></a><a href="#FNanchor_141"><span class="label">[141]</span></a> I have met, by the kindness of the author, with a little treatise which
contains a great deal of sound mental philosophy, with which in the main I
concur, and to which I am indebted for some very valuable suggestions.
This modest little book is entitled "The Heart of Man: An Attempt in Mental
Anatomy." The author is Mr. P. P. Bishop, a resident of San Mateo,
in Florida. It was printed at Chicago, by Shepard &amp; Johnson, for the
author, in 1883. I know not if it is on sale. I suppose that Mr. Bishop
was led to send me his interesting treatise by the publication, in the "Manhattan
Magazine," at New York, in 1884, of the substance of the first
three chapters of the present work. I take this opportunity of expressing
my high appreciation of his treatise, and of explaining the meaning of its
title. As I understand him, he uses the term "Heart of Man" as synonymous
with structure of the mind, and not as referring to what is figuratively
called "the human heart." He has explained "Mental Anatomy" as follows:
"The method of investigation, which I have employed in making my
way to the conclusions set forth in this discussion, I call 'The Anatomical
Method,' because it is based on the conception of mind as an organized
being, and aims to discover the structure of that being." ... "At the risk,"
he adds, "of appearing egotistical, I think it best to relate an experience."
He did not need to deprecate the appearance of egotism, for his method of
investigation, based on his own mental experience, was the very best that he
could have followed. It were to be wished that we could have more of this
kind of self-analysis by persons competent to make it, and less of theoretical
reasoning from premises more or less arbitrarily assumed.
</p>
<p>
I have endeavored to make my imaginary philosopher, Sophereus, avoid
the method of reasoning which I thus condemn, and to keep him within the
bounds of experience.</p></div>

without premeditation of both thought and language. "Improvisation"
means the same thing, but it is specially applied to the act of making poetry
or performing music extemporaneously, that is, without prevision of
what one is to say or sing. Rapid conversation is of the same nature. So
is an instantaneous and unpremeditated answer to a question.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_146" id="Footnote_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> If it is objected that I have allowed Sophereus to overstate the power
of the mind to deal better with difficulties after "a good night's sleep," as
we say, than it had dealt with them before, I will cite the testimony of one
of the most prolific of writers and one of the most self-observing of men,
Sir Walter Scott, whose greatest success was achieved in the field of poetical
and prose fiction. This is a department in which inventive genius is
the main reliance, and is put to its greatest tasks. In that part of Scott's
"Diary" which covers the year 1826&mdash;the period when he was writing
"Woodstock"&mdash;he says:
</p>
<p>
"The half-hour between waking and rising has all my life proved propitious
to any task which was exercising my invention. When I got over
any knotty difficulty in a story, or have had in former times to fill up a
passage in a poem, it was always when I first opened my eyes that the
desired ideas thronged upon me. This is so much the case that I am in the
habit of relying upon it and saying to myself when I am at a loss, 'Never
mind, we shall have it at seven o'clock to-morrow morning.' If I have forgot
a circumstance, a name, or a copy of verses, it is the same thing....
This morning I had some new ideas respecting 'Woodstock' which will make
the story better." (Lockhart's "Life of Scott," vol. viii, chap. lxviii.)
</p>
<p>
This, it is true, was the experience of a man of extraordinary genius,
whose facility of invention was as marvelous as the ease and rapidity with
which he wrote. But his experience was a very common one. It has been
shared by persons of much more humble faculties. I am sure that persons
in my own profession, who have been engaged in pursuits very different
from those of the poet or the novelist, will, from their own experience,
confirm what is assumed by Sophereus as a well-known mental phenomenon.
I could describe in detail many instances in which I have gone
through with the same fruition of new ideas, resulting from the acquisitions
obtained during sleep, or following from the benefits of sleep. For
example, when having to do with a complex state of facts, needing orderly
arrangement and analysis, it has repeatedly happened to me to rise in the
morning after a night of undisturbed sleep, with the whole of an entangled
skein unraveled, whereas before retiring to rest the mass of facts lay in
some confusion in the mind. In like manner the mind can often deal with
a legal question of a new and difficult character. The rule that ought to
be applied to a particular case has to be extracted from many precedents,
and perhaps none of them exactly cover the case in hand. On such occasions,
if one refrains from pushing the study of his subject while awake
to the severest analysis, and postpones the effort until the next morning,
the experience of Sir Walter is very likely to be repeated. "It was
always," he says, "when I first opened my eyes that the desired ideas
thronged upon me." I am persuaded, therefore, that although in the study
of any subject omission to master all its elements and details, when alone
one can accumulate them, is not to be recommended, there is undoubtedly
much to be gained by relieving the mind from the continued effort, and
allowing some hours of sleep to intervene, during which the mind can act
independently of all the bodily organs.
</p>
<p>
The question is, then, as above suggested, whether there come to us
during sleep acquisitions of new ideas with or without a simultaneous consciousness
that we are thinking of the subject, or whether the new ideas
follow from the benefits of sleep as a state of absolute rest and inactivity
of the brain, and of the intellectual faculties, so that when we awake both
the brain and the mental powers are in greater vigor. The expression used
by Scott in describing his own experience is that as soon as he awoke the
desired ideas <em>thronged</em> upon him. This might happen upon the hypothesis
that the desired ideas came because the brain and the mental powers,
refreshed by sleep, were in greater vigor. But I incline to believe that his
meaning was the reverse of this. At all events, it seems to me that the
true explanation of the phenomenon is that during sound and undisturbed
sleep of the body, including the brain, we do unconsciously think of the
subject on which our waking thoughts had been previously employed;
that in these states there are acquisitions of new ideas which we bring
with us out of the state in which they were acquired, or, as Sir Walter
expressed it, which <em>throng</em> upon us as soon as we open our eyes. While,
therefore, it may be said that this hypothesis assumes the existence of the
mind as a spiritual or intellectual entity capable of action as a thinking
being without any action of the bodily organs, the question is, on the other
hand, whether the phenomena here considered have not a very strong tendency
to prove that the mind is such a substantive and independent existence.
When it is remembered how common is the experience here referred
to, how various the phenomena are, how they are manifested on all kinds
of subjects, in regard to lines of conduct, and to everything about which we
are perplexed, and when we add these peculiar phenomena to the other
evidence which tends to establish the same belief in the existence of the
mind as something entirely apart from all its physical environment, it
seems to me that the argument becomes very strong, and that I have not
made my imaginary philosopher press it beyond its legitimate bounds.</p></div>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
